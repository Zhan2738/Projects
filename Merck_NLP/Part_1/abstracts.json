In vitro studies show 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent\ncannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) agonist, but little information is available about\nin vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To this end, the present study had\nthree aims: 1) to develop a validated method for detection of 5F-MDMB-PICA and\nits metabolites in rat plasma, 2) to utilize the method for investigating\npharmacokinetics of 5F-MDMB-PICA in rats, and 3) to relate 5F-MDMB-PICA\npharmacokinetics to pharmacodynamic effects. 5F-MDMB-PICA and its metabolites\nwere quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nand method validation followed forensic standards. Male Sprague-Dawley rats\nbearing surgically implanted jugular catheters and subcutaneous (s.c.)\ntemperature transponders received 5F-MDMB-PICA (50, 100, or 200\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, s.c.) or\nits vehicle. Blood samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480\u00a0min\npost-injection, and plasma was assayed using LC-MS/MS. At each blood draw, body\ntemperature, and catalepsy scores were recorded. Maximum plasma concentrations\n(Cmax) of 5F-MDMB-PICA rose linearly with increasing dose (1.72-6.20\u00a0ng/mL), and \nplasma half-life (t1/2) ranged from 400 to 1000\u00a0min\n5F-MDMB-PICA-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and 5OH-MDMB-PICA were the only\nmetabolites detected, and plasma concentrations were much lower than the parent\ndrug. 5F-MDMB-PICA induced robust hypothermia and catalepsy-like symptoms that\nwere significantly correlated with concentrations of 5F-MDMB-PICA. Radioligand\nbinding in rat brain membranes revealed 5F-MDMB-PICA displays high affinity for\nCB1 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0nM) while metabolites do not. In summary, 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent \nCB1 agonist in rats whose pharmacodynamic effects are related to circulating\nconcentrations of the parent drug and not its metabolites."

The results were similar when\nusing A\u03b2-PET as outcome. Plasma IPMS-WashU A\u03b242/40 and IPMS-Shim A\u03b242/40 showed\nhighest coefficients for correlations with CSF A\u03b242/40 (r range, 0.56-0.65). The \nBioFINDER results were replicated in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative cohort (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [5.4] years; 43.4% women), where the\nIP-MS-WashU assay performed significantly better than the IP-MS-UGOT, IA-Elc,\nIA-N4PE, and IA-Quan assays but not the IP-MS-Shim assay.\nConclusions and Relevance: The results from 2 independent cohorts indicate that\ncertain MS-based methods performed better than most of the immunoassays for\nplasma A\u03b242/40 when detecting brain A\u03b2 pathology."

Further clean-up\nusing acidified silica 44% cartridges was then performed to enable determination \nof PBDEs and HBCDs. Instrumental analysis of the target chemicals was performed\nusing gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass\nspectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A newly-optimized GC-MS/MS\nmethod was employed for the simultaneous determination of PAHs, OCPs, and Musks. \nThe lower limit of quantification (LOQ) values of PAHs, OCPs, and Musks were\n0.14-0.92 ng g-1, 0.06-0.38 ng g-1 and 0.07-0.40 ng g-1, respectively. PBDEs were\nquantified by GC-MS with electron capture negative ionization, and HBCDs and OPEs\nby LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative and positive ion mode,\nrespectively. Recovery experiments showed that the average recoveries and\nrelative standard deviations were 99-113% and 1-14% for PBDEs, 89-105% and 1-6%\nfor HBCDs, 71-120% and 3-17% for PAHs, 71-112% and 2-17% for OCPs, 77-120% and\n2-13% for Musks, and 80-127% and 1-14% for OPEs.

The accuracy, inter-day and intra-day\nprecision were 96-112%, 5.5-14.4%, and 3.7-14.1%, respectively, suggesting that\nthe method was accurate and precise in quantifying mIBG at multiple\nconcentrations in mouse plasma and liver homogenates. The extraction recovery was\n96-106% and the matrix effect was 95-110%, indicating that the method was\nreproducible in quantifying mIBG with minimal impact from the biological\nmatrices. In summary, we have developed and validated a fast, high-throughput\nquantification method of non-radiolabeled mIBG using LC-MS/MS.

To clarify the possibility of using this\nmethod to assess the potential carcinogenicity of genotoxic chemicals, we applied\nit to a set of 69 model compounds recommended by the European Center for the\nValidation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), with already-characterized genotoxic\npotential. Compared to conventional in vitro genotoxicity assays, including the\nAmes test, the \u03b3-H2AX assay by MS has high accuracy (94-96%) due to high\nsensitivity and specificity (88% and 100%, respectively). The dynamic profiles of\nmodel compounds after exposure in HepG2 cells were explored, and a mathematical\napproach was employed to simulate and quantitatively model the DNA repair\nkinetics of genotoxic carcinogens (GCs) based on \u03b3-H2AX time-effect curves up to \n8\u00a0h. Two crucial parameters, i.e., k (rate of \u03b3-H2AX decay) and t50 (time\nrequired for \u03b3-H2AX from maximum decrease to half) estimated by the least squares\nmethod, were achieved. An open web server to help researchers calculate these two\nkey parameters and profile simulated curves of the tested compound is available\nonline ( http://ccb1.bmi.ac.cn:81/shiny-server/sample-apps/prediction1/ ). We\ndetected a positive association between carcinogenic levels and k and t50 values \nof \u03b3-H2AX in tested GCs, validating the potential of using this MS-based \u03b3-H2AX\nin vitro assay to help preliminarily evaluate carcinogenicity and assess\ngenotoxicity. This approach may be used alone or integrated into an existing\nbattery of in vitro genetic toxicity tests."

We previously reported marked upregulation of \nBM components in internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) from type 2 DM (T2DM) patients\nby mass spectrometry. Here, we first sought to determine if BM accumulation is a \ncommon feature of different arteries in T2DM, and second, to identify other\neffects of T2DM on the arterial proteome.\nMETHODS: Human arterial samples collected during heart and vascular surgery from \nwell-characterized patients and stored in the Odense Artery Biobank were analysed\nby liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We\nincluded ascending thoracic aortas (ATA) (n\u2009=\u200910 (type 2 DM, T2DM) and n\u2009=\u200910\n(non-DM)); laser capture micro-dissected plaque- and media compartments from\ncarotid plaques (n\u2009=\u200910 (T2DM) and n\u2009=\u20099 (non-DM)); and media- and adventitia\ncompartments from ITAs (n\u2009=\u20099 (T2DM) and n\u2009=\u20097 (non-DM)).\nRESULTS: We first extended our previous finding of BM accumulation in arteries\nfrom T2DM patients, as 7 of 12 pre-defined BM proteins were significantly\nupregulated in bulk ATAs consisting of >\u200990% media. Although less pronounced, BM \ncomponents tended to be upregulated in the media of ITAs from T2DM patients, but \nnot in the neighbouring adventitia. Overall, we did not detect effects on BM\nproteins in carotid plaques or in the plaque-associated media. Instead,\ncomplement factors, an RNA-binding protein and fibrinogens appeared to be\nregulated in these tissues from T2DM patients.\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that accumulation of BM proteins is a general\nphenomenon in the medial layer of non-atherosclerotic arteries in patients with\nT2DM. Moreover, we identify additional T2DM-associated effects on the arterial\nproteome, which requires validation in future studies."

Cox proportional hazards\nregression analysis and survival analysis were used to differentiate the outcome \nof low- and high-risk patients, and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohort\nwas used for validation of the data set.

SNAP25 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and fostered\nglutamine metabolism of glioma cells, exerting a tumor suppressor role.\nOverexpressed SNAP25 exerted a lower expression level of MAP2, indicating poor\nneuronal plasticity and connectivity. SNAP25 could regulate glutaminase\n(GLS)-mediated glutaminolysis, and GLS knockdown could rescue the anti-tumor\neffect of SNAP25 in glioma cells.

To improve clinical testing efficiency, we \ndeveloped a single LC-MS method to simultaneously identify disorders of\noligosaccharide, mucopolysaccharide, and glycolipid metabolism with minimal\nsample preparation.\nMETHODS: We created a single chromatographic method for separating free glycans\nand glycolipids in their native form, using an amide column and high pH\nconditions. We used this glycomic profiling method both in untargeted analyses of\npatient and control urines using LC ion-mobility high-resolution MS (biomarker\ndiscovery), and targeted analyses of urine, serum, and dried blood spot samples\nby LC-MS/MS (clinical validation).\nRESULTS: Untargeted glycomic profiling revealed twenty biomarkers that could\nidentify and subtype mucopolysaccharidoses. We incorporated these with known\noligosaccharide and glycolipid biomarkers into a rapid test that identifies at\nleast 27 lysosomal storage disorders, including oligosaccharidoses,\nmucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses, glycogen storage disorders, and\ncongenital disorders of glycosylation and de-glycosylation. In a validation set\ncontaining 115 urine samples from patients with lysosomal storage disorders, all \nwere unambiguously distinguished from normal controls, with correct disease\nsubtyping for 88% (101/115) of cases. Glucosylsphingosine was reliably elevated\nin dried blood spots from Gaucher disease patients with baseline resolution from \ngalactosylsphingosine.\nCONCLUSION: Glycomic profiling by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry\nidentifies a range of lysosomal storage disorders. This test can be used in\nclinical evaluations to rapidly focus a diagnosis, as well as to clarify or\nsupport additional gene sequencing and enzyme studies."

Targeting the impairments in cholinergic and glutamatergic\nneurotransmissions with small molecules has been suggested as one of the\npotential disease-modifying approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tacrine, a\npotent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the first FDA approved drug\nfor the treatment of AD. Tacrine is also a low affinity antagonist of\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). However, tacrine was withdrawn from its\nclinical use later due to its hepatotoxicity. With an aim to develop novel high\naffinity multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) against AChE and NMDAR, with\nreduced hepatotoxicity, we performed in silico structure-based modifications on\ntacrine, chemical synthesis of the derivatives and in vitro validation of their\nactivities. Nineteen such derivatives showed inhibition with IC50 values in the\nrange of 18.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.09 - 184.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.23\u00a0nM against AChE and 0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 -\n38.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.64\u00a0\u03bcM against NMDAR. Some of the selected compounds also protected rat \nprimary cortical neurons from glutamate induced excitotoxicity. Two of the\ntacrine derived MTDLs, 201 and 208 exhibited in vivo efficacy in rats by\nprotecting against behavioral impairment induced by administration of the\nexcitotoxic agent, monosodium glutamate. Additionally, several of these\nsynthesized compounds also exhibited promising inhibitory activitiy against\nbutyrylcholinesterase. MTDL-201 was also devoid of hepatotoxicity in vivo. Given \nthe therapeutic potential of MTDLs in disease-modifying therapy, our studies\nrevealed several promising MTDLs among which 201 appears to be a potential\ncandidate for immediate preclinical evaluations."

Quantification of TZD plasma concentrations may be an\neffective and valuable method to balance the clinical efficacy and adverse\nreactions. This study aimed to establish a novel LC-MS assay for measuring TZD\nconcentrations in human plasma for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).\nMETHODS: After protein precipitation with acetonitrile, LC-MS quantification of\nTZD was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with chromatographic\nseparation using a mobile phase of MeOH and 0.1% formic acid in water. This\nmethod validation intends to investigate specificity, sensitivity, linearity,\nprecision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, and stability according to USFDA\nguidelines.\nRESULTS: This method showed good selectivity because no interfering peaks were\nobserved in the plasma samples during the 2-min run time. The range of the\ncalibration curve was 1-3000 ng/mL. The detection and quantification limits were \n0.3 and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracies were\n96.5-103.4%, with precision RSD% values of <5%, except for the limit of quality. \nThe mean TZD recovery from human plasma was 95.4-104.5%. Finally, this method was\nsuccessfully applied to TDM in 20 patients. The TZD plasma concentrations of the \npatients ranged between 21.5 and 2267.3 ng/mL.\nCONCLUSIONS: A novel analytical method was established to measure TZD by LC-MS\ncoupled with an automatic 2-dimensional liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer\ncoupler 9500 (LC-MS/MS-Mate 9500), which is superior to the ordinary LC-MS system\nin terms of separation, transport, anti-interference, sensitivity, and\nquantitative analysis stability."

The recovery percentage improved for\nall pesticides on quantitation with matrix matched standards when compared with\nsolvent standards. For pesticides with lower European Union (EU) maximum residue \nlimits (MRLs), an experiment at lower spiking concentrations of 0.01 and\n0.05\u2009mg\u2009kg-1 with lower dilutions (8\u00d7) reveals that almost all pesticides with\nlower EU MRLs (0.02 and 0.05\u2009mg\u2009kg-1 ) showed recoveries in the range 74-124% and\nrelative standard deviation (RSD) less than 20%.\nCONCLUSION: Theoretical limit of quantitation (LOQ) is proposed which ranged from\n0.01 to 0.18\u2009mg\u2009kg-1 for matrix matched standards. An LOQ of 0.01\u2009mg\u2009kg-1 was\neasily achieved for the pesticides with lower EU MRLs with lower dilutions (8\u00d7)\nwith exception of fipronil for which this can be achieved without dilution\nprovided matrix matched standards are used.

All samples were reduced and alkylated before\nanalysis on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer in high and nano flow mode.\nRESULTS: The half-life of ELA-32 in plasma and kidney were 47.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.7\u202fmin and\n44.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202fs, respectively. Using PEAKS Studio and manual data analysis, the most\nimportant fragments of ELA-32 with potential biological activity identified were \nELA-11, ELA-16, ELA-19 and ELA-20. The corresponding fragments resulting from the\nloss of C-terminal amino acids were also identified. Endogenous levels of these\npeptides could not be measured, as ELA peptides are prone to oxidation and poor\nchromatographic peaks.\nCONCLUSIONS: The relatively long ELA plasma half-life observed and identification\nof a potentially more stable fragment, ELA-16, may suggest that ELA could be a\nbetter tool compound and novel template for the development of new drugs acting\nat the apelin receptor."

Unfortunately, not all patients that receive RT will obtain a\ntherapeutic benefit, as cancer cells that either possess intrinsic\nradioresistance or develop resistance during treatment can reduce its efficacy.\nFor RT treatment regimens to become personalised, there is a need to identify\nbiomarkers that can predict and/or monitor a tumour's response to radiation. Here\nwe describe a novel method to identify such biomarkers. Liquid\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used on conditioned media (CM)\nsamples from a radiosensitive oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC cell line\n(MCF-7) to identify cancer-secreted biomarkers which reflected a response to\nradiation. A total of 33 radiation-induced secreted proteins that had higher (up \nto 12-fold) secretion levels at 24 h post-2 Gy radiation were identified.\nSecretomic results were combined with whole-transcriptome gene expression\nexperiments, using both radiosensitive and radioresistant cells, to identify a\nsignature related to intrinsic radiosensitivity. Gene expression analysis\nassessing the levels of the 33 proteins showed that 5 (YBX3, EIF4EBP2, DKK1,\nGNPNAT1 and TK1) had higher expression levels in the radiosensitive cells\ncompared to their radioresistant derivatives; 3 of these proteins (DKK1, GNPNAT1 \nand TK1) underwent in-lab and initial clinical validation. Western blot analysis \nusing CM samples from cell lines confirmed a significant increase in the release \nof each candidate biomarker from radiosensitive cells 24 h after treatment with a\n2 Gy dose of radiation; no significant increase in secretion was observed in the \nradioresistant cells after radiation. Immunohistochemistry showed that higher\nintracellular protein levels of the biomarkers were associated with greater\nradiosensitivity. Intracellular levels were further assessed in pre-treatment\nbiopsy tissues from patients diagnosed with ER+ BC that were subsequently treated\nwith breast-conserving surgery and RT. High DKK1 and GNPNAT1 intracellular levels\nwere associated with significantly increased recurrence-free survival times,\nindicating that these two candidate biomarkers have the potential to predict\nsensitivity to RT. We suggest that the methods highlighted in this study could be\nutilised for the identification of biomarkers that may have a potential clinical \nrole in personalising and optimising RT dosing regimens, whilst limiting the\nadministration of RT to patients who are unlikely to benefit."

The calibration curve showed\ncorrelation coefficient values higher than 0.999 in the range of 0.2 - 20.0\u00a0ng/mL\nfor bortezomib. The acceptance criteria of accuracy (relative error\u00a0<\u00a012.5%) and \nprecision (coefficient of variation\u00a0<\u00a010.7%) were met in all cases. The matrix\neffect was<13.2%, and the recovery was between 87.3 and 100.2%. DBS samples were \nshown to be stable when stored in cold conditions or at room temperature.\nDifferent hematocrit values did not significantly affect the accuracy of the\nmeasured concentrations. And there are no significant differences between\nbortezomib concentrations in DBS samples and plasma samples. This new method was \nsuccessfully used for clinical concentration determinations of bortezomib and can\nbe applied in future therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of\nbortezomib especially in pediatric patients."

Satisfactory linearity (r2\u00a0>\u00a00.99) was\nobtained for all the compounds. The intra- and inter-day precision values were\nlower than 5.79 and 14.1%, respectively. The limits of detection ranged from 0.01\nto 3\u00a0\u00b5g L-1 and the limits of quantification were from 0.1 to 5\u00a0\u00b5g L-1. The\nmethod was applied to 20 environmental wastewater samples, with caffeine being\nthe most widely detected compound, at the highest concentration of 392\u00a0\u00b5g L-1,\nwhile other compounds were detected in fewer samples at lower concentrations (up \nto 9.60\u00a0\u00b5g L-1). The lab-made modification is a cheaper option for on-line sample\npreparation, compared to commercially available on-line SPE cartridges and RAM\ncolumns. Moreover, a high-throughput procedure was achieved, with an analysis\ntime of 16\u00a0min including sample preparation and chromatographic separation. The\nsame RAM column was applied over 200 injections including method optimization,\nvalidation and application in wastewater samples without loss of analytical\nresponse."

Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry was\nused to quantify amodiaquine and its active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine, in\nplasma samples. A low sample volume of 100\u00a0\u00b5l, and high-throughput extraction\ntechnique using a supported liquid extraction (SLE+) technique on an automated\nliquid handler platform for faster sample processing are some of the advantages\nof this method.

However, the metabolic types of different tumors are diverse and\nlack of in-depth study. Here, through analysis of big databases and clinical\nsamples, we identified Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I(CPS1)-deficient\nhepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) subtype, explored tumorigenesis mechanism of this\nHCC subtype, and aimed to investigate metabolic reprogramming as target for HCC\nprevention.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: Pan-cancer study involving differentially expressed\nmetabolic genes of 7,764 tumor samples in 16 cancer types provided by The Cancer \nGenome Atlas(TCGA) demonstrated that urea cycle(UC) was liver-specific and\nHCC-downregulated. A large-scale gene expression data analysis including a total \nof 2,596 HCC cases in 7 HCCDB datasets combined with a total of 17,444\nhepatectomy cohort data identified a specific CPS1-deficent HCC subtype with poor\nclinical prognosis. In vitro and in vivo validation confirmed crucial role of\nCPS1 in HCC. LC-MS assay and Seahorse analysis revealed that UC\ndysregulation(UCD) led to the deceleration of the tricarboxylic acid(TCA) cycle, \nwhile excess ammonia caused by CPS1 deficiency activated fatty acid\n\u03b2-oxidation(FAO) through p-AMPK. Mechanistically, FAO provided sufficient ATP for\ncell proliferation and enhanced chemoresistance of HCC cells by activating FOXM1.\nSubcutaneous xenograft tumor models and patient-derived organoids(PDOs) were\nemployed to identify that blocking FAO by Eto may provide therapeutic benefit to \nHCC patients with CPS1-deficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results prove a direct link between UCD and\ncancer stemness in HCC, define a CPS1-deficient HCC subtype through big-data\nmining, and provide insights for novel therapeutic for this type of HCC through\ntargeting FAO."

Currently, there is a lack of generic methods\ncapable of determining AFs both at postharvest stages in agricultural products\nand preharvest stages, namely, the agricultural soil. Here, we present a simple\nand reliable method for quantitative analysis of AFs in soil and food matrices at\nenvironmentally relevant concentrations for the first time, using the same\nextraction procedure and chromatography, either by HPLC-FLD or LC-MS. AFs were\nextracted from matrices by ultrasonication using an acetonitrile/water mixture\n(84:16, v + v) without extensive and time-consuming cleanup procedures. Food\nextracts were defatted with n-hexane. Matrix effects in terms of signal\nsuppression/enhancement (SSE) for HPLC-FLD were within \u00b120% for all matrices\ntested. For LC-MS, the SSE values were mostly within \u00b120% for soil matrices but\noutside \u00b120% for all food matrices. The sensitivity of the method allowed\nquantitative analysis even at trace levels with quantification limits (LOQs)\nbetween 0.04 and 0.23 \u03bcg kg-1 for HPLC-FLD and 0.06-0.23 \u03bcg kg-1 for LC-MS.

Phenolic-rich extracts from murtilla berries of the 19-1\ngenotype (ETE 19-1) significantly reduced polyglutamine peptide aggregation\nlevels, correlating with the modulation in the expression levels of\nautophagy-related proteins. Using LC-MS and molecular network analysis we\ncorrelated the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ellagitannins with the\nprotective effects of ETE 19-1 effects on protein aggregation.

The extraction capabilities of MeOH and\nACN on the AF metabolome were equivalent. Lyophilization also had no significant \nimpact and usefulness on the placental tissue metabolome profiling. Considering\nthe placental lipidome, MTBE extraction was more informative because it allowed\nextraction of a slightly higher number of lipids, in higher concentration. This\nproof-of-concept study assessing the metabolomics and lipidomics of the AF and\nthe placenta revealed changes in both metabolisms, at two different stages of rat\ngestation, and allowed a detailed prenatal metabolic fingerprinting."

A radiomic\nsignature was built with selected features in the training cohort and validated\nin the validation cohort. The total protein extracted from tumor samples was\nanalyzed with LC/MS and iTRAQ technology. Gene modules acquired by clustering\nwere chosen for their diagnostic significance. A radiogenomic map linking\nradiomic features to gene modules was constructed with the Spearman correlation\nmatrix. Genes in modules related to metastasis were extracted for Gene Ontology\n(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment\nanalyses, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built to identify\nthe hub genes in the modules. Finally, the screened hub genes were validated by\nimmunohistochemistry analysis.\nResults: The radiomic signature showed good performance for predicting CLN status\nin training and validation cohorts, with area under curve of 0.873 and 0.831\nrespectively. A radiogenomic map was created with nine significant correlations\nbetween radiomic features and gene modules, and two of them had higher\ncorrelation coefficient.

As an alternative to liquid\noral fluid, dried oral fluid spots (DOFS) is a simple and a low-cost sampling\ntechnique. It has shown improved stability compared to liquid samples, allowing\nfor the possibility to preserve the specimens under various temperature and\nhumidity conditions. The sampling strategy is straightforward and involves the\napplication of a small quantity of oral fluid aliquot to a paper substrate that\nis set to air dry allowing for on-site collection at a large-scale demand. The\ngoal of this study is to study THC and CBD extraction from DOFS, applying a\nprevious established protocol for a LC-MS/MS qualitative method validation.\nAlthough other drugs of abuse have been included in DOFS methods, this is the\nfirst method validation including cannabinoids. An alternative oral fluid\nextraction method (WAX-S tips) is demonstrated to improve the recovery of the\nanalytes.\nMETHODS: A pool of blank oral fluid was used to prepare THC and CBD spiked DOFS\nsamples for method validation and application. Spiked oral fluid was used to\ndemonstrate WAX-S tips THC and CBD extraction. All samples were analyzed on a\nLC-MS/MS instrument.\nRESULTS: The qualitative method validation for THC and CBD confirmation in DOFS\nincluded method selectivity, matrix effects (<\u200920%), recovery (average of 25%),\nprocess efficiency (average of 21%), LOD (2\u00a0ng/mL for THC and 4\u00a0ng/mL for CBD),\nabsence of carryover, and DOFS stability (70% in 35\u00a0days) as figures of merit.\nThe method application in blindly prepared samples demonstrated the method\ncapability to identify THC and CBD. WAX-S tips extraction showed an average of\n91% recovery of THC and CBD from liquid oral fluid.\nCONCLUSIONS: THC and CBD extraction from DOFS showed low recoveries. However, the\nLC-MS/MS qualitative confirmation of THC and CBD in DOFS could improve\ncannabinoids screening in oral fluid, as it shows adequate LOD and stability over\ntime. This method has potential for assisting the screening of drivers under\npossible drug influence by facilitating sample transportation and temporary\nstorage in dried spot form.

The\nchromatographic analysis was performed by a direct dilute-and-shoot procedure\nusing a Phenomenex Kinetex\u00ae Phenyl-Hexyl column (10\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0mm i.d., 1.7\u00a0\u00b5m) and\ntwo mobile phases (A: 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution with 5\u00a0mM ammonium\nacetate, B: 0.1% formic acid methanolic solution). The mass fragments were\ncollected under the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The linearity range\nlocated in 1.0-50.0\u00a0ng/mL for quantitative analysis. The limit of detection and\nlower limit of quantification for 74 phenethylamines were 0.5\u00a0ng/mL and\n1.0\u00a0ng/mL, respectively. The method was validated and further applied to analyze \nauthentic urine samples. Twenty samples were tested positive of seven\nphenethylamines from 67 samples, whereas the contents detected were 9.8\u00a0ng/mL to \n147.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with dilution factors of 40 to 20,000 folds."

After acetonitrile protein precipitation, chromatographic \nseparation was achieved with a Phenomenex synergy polar reverse phase (4\u00a0\u03bcm,\n2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0mm) column and a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1%\nformic acid in water over a 5-min run time. Detection was performed on a\nQuattromicro quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray, positive-mode\nionization. The assay was linear over the concentration range 50-5000\u00a0ng/mL and\nproved to be accurate (103.4-105.4%) and precise (<5.0%CV). Hemolysis (10% RBC)\nand use of heparin as anticoagulant did not impact quantitation. Recovery from\nplasma varied between 103.0-107.7% and matrix effect was -47.5 to -41.3%. Plasma \nfreeze-thaw stability (97.7-104.9%), stability for 3\u00a0months at -80\u00b0C\n(103.4-111.4%), and stability for 4\u00a0h at room temperature (100.1-104.9%) were all\nacceptable.

The aim of this study was to improve the analytical control strategy by \ndeveloping a single method to analyse residues of prohibited pharmacologically\nactive substances in milk. For this, a single method was developed to analyse 16 \nprohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five different\nsubstance classes at required or recommended levels: nitroimidazoles at 3\u00a0\u03bcg\nkg-1, nitrofurans at 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg kg-1, chloramphenicol at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg kg-1, dapsone at 5\u00a0\u03bcg\nkg-1 and chlorpromazine at 1\u00a0\u03bcg kg-1. Milk sample preparation started with an\nacid hydrolysis combined with a derivatisation. These steps were followed by a\nclean-up consisting of a dispersive solid-phase extraction and a liquid-liquid\nextraction. Finally, the sample extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography\ncombined with tandem mass spectrometry, operating alternately in the positive and\nnegative mode. The method was fully validated according to Commission Decision\n2002/657/EC for bovine milk and additionally validated for caprine milk. The\nvalidation proved that the method is highly effective to detect and confirm all\n16 substances in bovine and caprine milk and, additionally to quantify 15 of\nthese substances in bovine milk and 13 of these substances in caprine milk. This \nstudy resulted in a new multi-class method to detect, quantify and confirm the\nidentity of 16 prohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five\ndifferent substance classes in two types of milk."

A typical\napproach to enhance the proteome depth is employing offline two-dimensional (2D) \nfractionation techniques before reversed-phase nanoLC-MS/MS analysis\n(1D-nanoLC-MS). These additional sample preparation steps usually require\nextensive sample manipulation, which could result in sample alteration and sample\nloss. Here, we present and compare 1D-nanoLC-MS with an automated online-2D\nhigh-pH RP \u00d7 low pH RP separation method for deep proteome profiling using a\nnanoLC system coupled to a high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometer. The\nproof-of-principle study permitted the identification of ca. 500 proteins with\n\u223c10,000 peptides in 15 enzymatically digested crude serum samples collected from \nhealthy donors in 3 laboratories across Europe. The developed method identified\n60% more peptides in comparison with conventional 1D nanoLC-MS/MS analysis with\nca. 4 times lower throughput while retaining the quantitative information. Serum \nsample preparation related changes were revealed by applying unsupervised\nclassification techniques and, therefore, must be taken into account while\nplanning multicentric biomarker discovery and validation studies. Overall, this\nnovel method reduces sample complexity and boosts the number of peptide and\nprotein identifications without the need for extra sample handling procedures for\nsamples equivalent to less than 1 \u03bcL of blood, which expands the space for\npotential biomarker discovery by looking deeper into the composition of\nbiofluids."

A specific\nand sensitive LC-MS/MS method with polarity switching was developed and validated\nfor the simultaneous determination of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B in rat plasma, liver, \nbrain, urine and fecal samples. Method validation was investigated to demonstrate\nthe lower limit of quantification linearity, precision and accuracy, matrix\neffect and recovery, stability and dilution reliability for IMMH-010 and YPD-29B.\nThis validated method was successfully applied to investigate the\npharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B in\nrats. After oral administration of IMMH-010 maleate to rats, IMMH-010 was rapidly\nand extensively converted to the active metabolite YPD-29B. The areas under the\nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B were proportional\nto the dose in the range of 10-100\u00a0mg/kg. IMMH-010 was primarily distributed in\nthe adrenal gland, lymph nodes, heart, liver and spleen. YPD-29B was mainly\nobserved in the liver, lymph, kidney, and lung. Approximately 28.81% of the\nIMMH-010 dose was recovered in the urine and feces within 72\u00a0h, including\nunchanged IMMH-010 (7.99%) and YPD-29B (20.82%).
