"Food ingredients hold a higher nutritional value as a botanical supplement
playing a vital role in modifying and maintaining the physiological conditions
that improve human health benefits. The Kashmir saffron (Crocus sativus L; KCS)
obtained from dried stigmas is known for its aroma precursors and apocarotenoid
derivatives, imparting a wide range of medicinal values and therapeutic benefits.
In the present study, a simultaneous determination of apocarotenoids and
flavonoids in stigma-based botanical supplements was carried out using analytical
investigations. The high-performance thin-layer chromatography-based qualitative 
analysis of the raw material (stigmas, stamens, and tepals) and stigma extract
has been carried out to identify apocarotenoids and flavonoids. The rapid
HPLC-PDA method for the simultaneous quantification of KCS apocarotenoids was
robust, precise (<5.0%), linear (R 2 > 0.99), and accurate (80-110%) as per the
single-laboratory validation data. Furthermore, the combined-expanded uncertainty
(95%; K = 2) was calculated and found as 0.0035-0.007% (<5.0%) as per the
EURACHEM guide for this HPLC analysis. Additionally, an untargeted identification
of 36 compounds in the botanical supplement was based on the elution order,
UV-vis spectra, mass fragmentation pattern, and standards by ESI-MS/MS analysis
with comprehensive chromatographic fingerprinting. Thus, these analytical
approaches enable a composite profile of the stigma-based extract as a potential 
supplement for human health benefits."

"5F-MDMB-PICA is a popular synthetic cannabinoid associated with analytically
confirmed intoxications. In vitro studies show 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent
cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) agonist, but little information is available about
in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To this end, the present study had
three aims: 1) to develop a validated method for detection of 5F-MDMB-PICA and
its metabolites in rat plasma, 2) to utilize the method for investigating
pharmacokinetics of 5F-MDMB-PICA in rats, and 3) to relate 5F-MDMB-PICA
pharmacokinetics to pharmacodynamic effects. 5F-MDMB-PICA and its metabolites
were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
and method validation followed forensic standards. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
bearing surgically implanted jugular catheters and subcutaneous (s.c.)
temperature transponders received 5F-MDMB-PICA (50, 100, or 200 μg/kg, s.c.) or
its vehicle. Blood samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min
post-injection, and plasma was assayed using LC-MS/MS. At each blood draw, body
temperature, and catalepsy scores were recorded. Maximum plasma concentrations
(Cmax) of 5F-MDMB-PICA rose linearly with increasing dose (1.72-6.20 ng/mL), and 
plasma half-life (t1/2) ranged from 400 to 1000 min
5F-MDMB-PICA-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and 5OH-MDMB-PICA were the only
metabolites detected, and plasma concentrations were much lower than the parent
drug. 5F-MDMB-PICA induced robust hypothermia and catalepsy-like symptoms that
were significantly correlated with concentrations of 5F-MDMB-PICA. Radioligand
binding in rat brain membranes revealed 5F-MDMB-PICA displays high affinity for
CB1 (IC50 = 2 nM) while metabolites do not. In summary, 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent 
CB1 agonist in rats whose pharmacodynamic effects are related to circulating
concentrations of the parent drug and not its metabolites."

"Importance: Blood-based tests for brain amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology are needed for
widespread implementation of Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers in clinical care
and to facilitate patient screening and monitoring of treatment responses in
clinical trials.
Objective: To compare the performance of plasma Aβ42/40 measured using 8
different Aβ assays when detecting abnormal brain Aβ status in patients with
early AD.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This study included 182 cognitively unimpaired
participants and 104 patients with mild cognitive impairment from the BioFINDER
cohort who were enrolled at 3 different hospitals in Sweden and underwent Aβ
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
plasma collection from 2010 to 2014. Plasma Aβ42/40 was measured using an
immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry developed at Washington University 
(IP-MS-WashU), antibody-free liquid chromatography MS developed by Araclon
(LC-MS-Arc), and immunoassays from Roche Diagnostics (IA-Elc); Euroimmun (IA-EI);
and Amsterdam University Medical Center, ADx Neurosciences, and Quanterix
(IA-N4PE). Plasma Aβ42/40 was also measured using an IP-MS-based method from
Shimadzu in 200 participants (IP-MS-Shim) and an IP-MS-based method from the
University of Gothenburg (IP-MS-UGOT) and another immunoassay from Quanterix
(IA-Quan) among 227 participants. For validation, 122 participants (51
cognitively normal, 51 with mild cognitive impairment, and 20 with AD dementia)
were included from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who underwent
Aβ-PET and plasma Aβ assessments using IP-MS-WashU, IP-MS-Shim, IP-MS-UGOT,
IA-Elc, IA-N4PE, and IA-Quan assays.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Discriminative accuracy of plasma Aβ42/40 quantified 
using 8 different assays for abnormal CSF Aβ42/40 and Aβ-PET status.
Results: A total of 408 participants were included in this study. In the
BioFINDER cohort, the mean (SD) age was 71.6 (5.6) years and 49.3% of the cohort 
were women. When identifying participants with abnormal CSF Aβ42/40 in the whole 
cohort, plasma IP-MS-WashU Aβ42/40 showed significantly higher accuracy (area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.90)
than LC-MS-Arc Aβ42/40, IA-Elc Aβ42/40, IA-EI Aβ42/40, and IA-N4PE Aβ42/40 (AUC
range, 0.69-0.78; P < .05). Plasma IP-MS-WashU Aβ42/40 performed significantly
better than IP-MS-UGOT Aβ42/40 and IA-Quan Aβ42/40 (AUC, 0.84 vs 0.68 and 0.64,
respectively; P < .001), while there was no difference in the AUCs between
IP-MS-WashU Aβ42/40 and IP-MS-Shim Aβ42/40 (0.87 vs 0.83; P = .16) in the 2
subcohorts where these biomarkers were available. The results were similar when
using Aβ-PET as outcome. Plasma IPMS-WashU Aβ42/40 and IPMS-Shim Aβ42/40 showed
highest coefficients for correlations with CSF Aβ42/40 (r range, 0.56-0.65). The 
BioFINDER results were replicated in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative cohort (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [5.4] years; 43.4% women), where the
IP-MS-WashU assay performed significantly better than the IP-MS-UGOT, IA-Elc,
IA-N4PE, and IA-Quan assays but not the IP-MS-Shim assay.
Conclusions and Relevance: The results from 2 independent cohorts indicate that
certain MS-based methods performed better than most of the immunoassays for
plasma Aβ42/40 when detecting brain Aβ pathology."

"Household dust is a sink for multiple toxic chemicals with known or suspected
potential health effects. However, most dust exposure studies focus on a few
chemicals, which may limit overall understanding of human exposure
characteristics because people spend most of their time indoors. This paper
describes the development and evaluation of a multi-residue analysis of 20
organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 8
polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (PBDEs), 3 hexabromocyclododecane
(HBCDs), 8 synthetic musks (Musks), and 7 organophosphate esters (OPEs) in indoor
dusts. After extraction with acetone/hexane (v/v, 1 : 1), all target compounds
were fractionated with a Florisil solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge into two
fractions: PAHs, PBDEs, HBCDs, OCPs and Musks, which were eluted with
hexane/dichloromethane, and OPEs eluted with ethyl acetate. Further clean-up
using acidified silica 44% cartridges was then performed to enable determination 
of PBDEs and HBCDs. Instrumental analysis of the target chemicals was performed
using gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass
spectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A newly-optimized GC-MS/MS
method was employed for the simultaneous determination of PAHs, OCPs, and Musks. 
The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) values of PAHs, OCPs, and Musks were
0.14-0.92 ng g-1, 0.06-0.38 ng g-1 and 0.07-0.40 ng g-1, respectively. PBDEs were
quantified by GC-MS with electron capture negative ionization, and HBCDs and OPEs
by LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative and positive ion mode,
respectively. Recovery experiments showed that the average recoveries and
relative standard deviations were 99-113% and 1-14% for PBDEs, 89-105% and 1-6%
for HBCDs, 71-120% and 3-17% for PAHs, 71-112% and 2-17% for OCPs, 77-120% and
2-13% for Musks, and 80-127% and 1-14% for OPEs. Validation experiments showed
that the method achieved good accuracy. The developed method was used to analyze 
SRM 2585 and real indoor dust samples to demonstrate its suitability for routine 
analysis. The target contaminants were widely detected in SRM 2585 and indoor
dust collected from Wuhan of Central China, with PAHs the major species, followed
by OPEs, OCPs, and PBDEs."

"Background: A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Method: 
For the quantification of voriconazole in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was
developed and validated, to guide the clinical use of voriconazole in the
treatment of central nervous system infections. CSF samples were treated by
protein precipitation with methanol containing fluconazole as the internal
standard (IS). The supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Agilent
EclipsePlus C18 column eluted with a methanol and water mobile phase at a flow
rate of 0.4 mL min-1. Quantification was performed by multiple-reaction
monitoring using the precursor and product ion pair 350/280.9 for voriconazole
and 307/219.9 for fluconazole. Results: The calibration curve was linear over the
range of 0.1-10.0 μg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9991). The inter-day and intra-day precisions
were <4.20% and <9.97%, respectively. The recoveries for the three concentrations
(0.2, 1.0, and 8.0 μg mL-1) were 99.96%, 107.00%, and 99.85%, and the matrix
effects were 99.35%, 103.41%, and 99.64%, respectively. The stability under
various conditions was also acceptable. The study also demonstrated that the CSF 
matrix could be replaced by plasma and artificial CSF. Conclusion: A simple and
accurate method for the determination of voriconazole concentrations in human CSF
was developed and validated, which can be used for drug monitoring in the
treatment of central nervous system infections."

"meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) is a radiopharmaceutical used for the diagnosis
and treatment of neuroendocrine cancers. Previous quantification of mIBG in
biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies mainly relied on the use of
radiolabeled mIBG, which involves the handling of highly radioactive materials.
The goal of this study was to develop a nonradioactive analytical method for
quantifying mIBG in mouse plasma and tissue homogenates using high performance
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples were prepared 
for analysis using a protein precipitation method. Mass spectrometry analysis was
performed using 4-hydroxyphenformin as the internal standard, and the
mass-to-charge transitions were 276.1 → 217.0 for mIBG and 222.1 → 121.0 for
4-hydroxyphenformin. The quantification limit of mIBG was 0.98 ng/mL, and the
method was linear up to 500 ng/mL. The accuracy, inter-day and intra-day
precision were 96-112%, 5.5-14.4%, and 3.7-14.1%, respectively, suggesting that
the method was accurate and precise in quantifying mIBG at multiple
concentrations in mouse plasma and liver homogenates. The extraction recovery was
96-106% and the matrix effect was 95-110%, indicating that the method was
reproducible in quantifying mIBG with minimal impact from the biological
matrices. In summary, we have developed and validated a fast, high-throughput
quantification method of non-radiolabeled mIBG using LC-MS/MS. This method is
reproducible, accurate, and precise, and can be used to quantify mIBG in plasma
and tissue matrices to determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of mIBG
in preclinical animal models."

"A comprehensive screening method that is specific, accurate, and customizable is 
necessary in any forensic toxicology laboratory. Most laboratories utilize some
form of immunoassay testing as it is reliable and sensitive with minimal sample
preparation and is relatively inexpensive to simultaneously screen for multiple
classes of drugs with different chemical properties. However, accessibility to
more specific technology and instrumentation such as mass spectrometry has
increased and therefore using immunoassay as the screening method of choice may
be revisited. A screening method for 42 drugs in postmortem blood was developed
and validated following the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for
Forensic Science (OSAC) guidelines for toxicology method validation. The method
was developed using minimal sample preparation of postmortem blood consisting
only of a protein precipitation. Only two internal standards were used which
greatly reduces the cost of implementing this method. Limit of detection (LOD),
interference studies, processed sample stability and ion suppression/enhancement 
were examined. Additionally, over 100 case samples were analyzed by both the
current enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing procedure and the
proposed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) screening
method. The comparison determined that the LC/MS-MS method performed as well as
or better than the ELISA in nearly all cases. The ability to add additional
target drugs increases the laboratory's scope of analysis as well. This method is
ideal for forensic laboratories wishing to improve screening while working within
budget constraints."

"Phenibut, a GABAB agonist structurally similar to baclofen, is not approved for
medical use in the United States, but is available through internet suppliers for
recreational use. Calls to poison control centers for phenibut have increased
over the last five years, and there are many case reports of severe acute
intoxications and withdrawals requiring hospitalization. This case report
describes the autopsy and toxicology findings of a 26-year-old male found dead at
home with phenibut containers on scene. Autopsy findings and routine toxicology
testing were generally unremarkable. Scene findings prompted the validation of a 
qualitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method that confirmed 
the presence of phenibut in blood and urine."

"Two simple and low-cost QuEChERS approaches were optimized and validated for
multimycotoxin determination in grains by UPLC-MS/MS and applied to assess
effectiveness of controlled atmosphere (CA) storage in preventing mycotoxin
contamination. Common bean, soybean, and maize samples were stored for 6 months. 
CA treatments were conducted varying O2 and CO2 partial pressures, temperatures, 
and moisture contents of the chambers. In the validation study for common bean
and maize, 8 out of 11 mycotoxins were successfully validated. For soybean, 10
out of 11 mycotoxins were validated. Aflatoxin B1 was detected in all
commodities. Statistical tests suggest that storage temperature played a key role
in aflatoxin B1 concentrations in common bean and soybean, but had no influence
on maize. Maize was also positive for fumonisins B1 and B2. Differences in
fumonisin concentrations were not significant among different treatments.
Concentrations of aflatoxin B1 in some samples exceeded legislation's maximum
levels. Thus, some of the CA treatments applied were effective in preventing
mycotoxin contamination in common bean and soybean but were not effective for
maize."

"Amongst all toxicological endpoints, carcinogenicity might pose the greatest
concern. Genetic damage has been considered an important underlying mechanism for
the carcinogenicity of chemical substances. The demand for in vitro genotoxic
tests as alternative approaches is growing rapidly with the implementation of new
regulations for compounds. However, currently available in vitro genotoxicity
tests are often limited by relatively high false positive rates. Moreover, few
studies have explored carcinogenicity potential by in vitro genotoxicity testing 
due to the shortage of suitable toxicological biomarkers to link gene damage with
cancer risk. γ-H2AX is a recently acknowledged attractive endpoint (biomarker)
for evaluating DNA damage and can simultaneously reflect the DNA damage response 
and repair of cells. We previously reported an ultrasensitive and reliable
method, namely stable-isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS), for detecting cellular γ-H2AX and evaluating
genotoxic chemicals. More importantly, our method can dynamically monitor the
specific processes of genotoxic compounds affecting DNA damage and repair
reflected by the amount of γ-H2AX. To clarify the possibility of using this
method to assess the potential carcinogenicity of genotoxic chemicals, we applied
it to a set of 69 model compounds recommended by the European Center for the
Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), with already-characterized genotoxic
potential. Compared to conventional in vitro genotoxicity assays, including the
Ames test, the γ-H2AX assay by MS has high accuracy (94-96%) due to high
sensitivity and specificity (88% and 100%, respectively). The dynamic profiles of
model compounds after exposure in HepG2 cells were explored, and a mathematical
approach was employed to simulate and quantitatively model the DNA repair
kinetics of genotoxic carcinogens (GCs) based on γ-H2AX time-effect curves up to 
8 h. Two crucial parameters, i.e., k (rate of γ-H2AX decay) and t50 (time
required for γ-H2AX from maximum decrease to half) estimated by the least squares
method, were achieved. An open web server to help researchers calculate these two
key parameters and profile simulated curves of the tested compound is available
online ( http://ccb1.bmi.ac.cn:81/shiny-server/sample-apps/prediction1/ ). We
detected a positive association between carcinogenic levels and k and t50 values 
of γ-H2AX in tested GCs, validating the potential of using this MS-based γ-H2AX
in vitro assay to help preliminarily evaluate carcinogenicity and assess
genotoxicity. This approach may be used alone or integrated into an existing
battery of in vitro genetic toxicity tests."

"In light of the recent global pandemic, Molnupiravir (MPV) or EIDD-2801,
developed for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated influenza, is now
being trialled for the treatment of infections caused by highly pathogenic
coronaviruses, including COVID-19. A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and 
validated for the simultaneous quantification of MPV and its metabolite
ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) in human plasma and saliva. The analytes were
extracted from the matrices by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. This was
followed by drying and subsequently injecting the reconstituted solutions onto
the column. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a polar Atlantis C18
column with gradient elution of 1 mM Ammonium acetate in water (pH4.3) and 1 mM
Ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. Analyte detection was conducted in negative
ionisation mode using SRM. Analysis was performed using stable isotopically
labelled (SIL) internal standards (IS). The m/z transitions were: MPV
(328.1→126.0), NHC (258.0→125.9) and MPV-SIL (331.0→129.0), NHC-SIL
(260.9→128.9). Validation was over a linear range of 2.5-5000 ng/ml for both
plasma and saliva. Across four different concentrations, precision and accuracy
(intra- and inter-day) were 15%; and recovery of both analytes from plasma and
saliva was between 95% and 100% and 65-86% respectively. Clinical pharmacokinetic
studies are underway utilising this method for determination of MPV and its
metabolite in patients with COVID-19 infection."

"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of
chemicals. While some have been phased out internationally due to concerns over
their human and environmental health risks, novel alternative PFASs continue to
be manufactured and detected in environmental samples. The occurrence and fate of
these alternatives remain poorly understood. The present study investigated the
occurrence of an emerging class of PFAS alternative, the monohydrogen-substituted
perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (H-PFCAs), in conjunction with the more
well-known PFCAs. A weak anion exchange solid phase extraction-liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for quantitative determination of 
H-PFCAs in surface water was developed, validated, and applied on samples
collected from the Netherlands. To improve chromatography, especially for
short-chain (H-)PFCAs, an ion-pairing agent, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen
sulphate, was used. The method was validated for linearity (R2 > 0.99),
instrumental detection limits (0.01-0.09 ng/mL), method detection limits
(0.03-0.75 ng/mL), matrix effects (<20%), percent absolute- and relative recovery
(57-121%), trueness (130-80%), repeatability (<20%), and within-lab
reproducibility (<20%). Eleven out of fourteen PFASs showed acceptable results.
Application of the newly validated method to surface water throughout the
Netherlands revealed trace levels of H-PFCAs (including two new H-PFCAs) and high
concentrations of PFCAs."

"Dried urine spots (DUS) represent a potential alternative sample storage for
forensic toxicological analysis. The aim of the current study was to develop and 
validate a liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric procedure for the
detection and quantitative determination of cannabinoids and metabolites in DUS. 
A two-step extraction was performed on DUS and urine samples. An LC-MS/MS system 
was operated in multiple reaction monitoring and positive polarization mode. The 
method was checked for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, 
recovery, matrix effects and carryover. The method was applied to 70 urine
samples collected from healthy volunteers and drug addicts undergoing withdrawal 
treatment. The method was successfully developed for DUS. LODs lower than 2.0
ng/mL were obtained for all the monitored substances. All the validation
parameters fulfilled the acceptance criteria either for DUS or urine. Among the
real samples, 45 cases provided positive results for at least one compound. A
good quali-quantitative agreement was obtained between DUS and urine. A good
stability of THC, THCCOOH and THCCOOH-gluc was observed after a 24 h storage, in 
contrast to previously published results. DUS seems to provide a good alternative
storage condition for urine that should be checked for the presence of
cannabinoids and metabolites."

"BACKGROUND: Basement membrane (BM) accumulation is a hallmark of micro-vessel
disease in diabetes mellitus (DM). We previously reported marked upregulation of 
BM components in internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) from type 2 DM (T2DM) patients
by mass spectrometry. Here, we first sought to determine if BM accumulation is a 
common feature of different arteries in T2DM, and second, to identify other
effects of T2DM on the arterial proteome.
METHODS: Human arterial samples collected during heart and vascular surgery from 
well-characterized patients and stored in the Odense Artery Biobank were analysed
by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We
included ascending thoracic aortas (ATA) (n = 10 (type 2 DM, T2DM) and n = 10
(non-DM)); laser capture micro-dissected plaque- and media compartments from
carotid plaques (n = 10 (T2DM) and n = 9 (non-DM)); and media- and adventitia
compartments from ITAs (n = 9 (T2DM) and n = 7 (non-DM)).
RESULTS: We first extended our previous finding of BM accumulation in arteries
from T2DM patients, as 7 of 12 pre-defined BM proteins were significantly
upregulated in bulk ATAs consisting of > 90% media. Although less pronounced, BM 
components tended to be upregulated in the media of ITAs from T2DM patients, but 
not in the neighbouring adventitia. Overall, we did not detect effects on BM
proteins in carotid plaques or in the plaque-associated media. Instead,
complement factors, an RNA-binding protein and fibrinogens appeared to be
regulated in these tissues from T2DM patients.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that accumulation of BM proteins is a general
phenomenon in the medial layer of non-atherosclerotic arteries in patients with
T2DM. Moreover, we identify additional T2DM-associated effects on the arterial
proteome, which requires validation in future studies."

"Protein is a major component of all biological evidence. Proteomic genotyping is 
the use of genetically variant peptides (GVPs) that contain single-amino-acid
polymorphisms to infer the genotype of matching nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphisms for the individual from whom the protein sample originated. This
can be used to statistically associate an individual to evidence found at a crime
scene. The utility of the inferred genotype increases as the detection of GVPs
increases, which is the direct result of technology transfer to mass spectrometry
platforms typically available. Digests of single (2 cm) human hair shafts from
three European and two African subjects were analyzed using data-dependent
acquisition on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap system,
data-independent acquisition and a variant of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) 
on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid system, and multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) on an Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole system. In our hands, average GVP
detection from a selected panel of 24 GVPs increased from 6.5 ± 1.1 and 3.1 ± 0.8
using data-dependent and -independent acquisition to 9.5 ± 0.7 and 11.7 ± 1.7
using PRM and MRM (p < 0.05), respectively. PRM resulted in a 1.3-fold increase
in detection sensitivity, and MRM resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in detection
sensitivity. This increase in biomarker detection has a functional impact on the 
statistical association of a protein sample and an individual. Increased
biomarker sensitivity, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling, produced a
median-estimated random match probability of over 1 in 10 trillion from a single 
hair using targeted proteomics. For PRM and MRM, detected GVPs were validated by 
the inclusion of stable isotope-labeled peptides in each sample, which served
also as a detection trigger. This research accomplishes two aims: the
demonstration of utility for alternative analytical platforms in proteomic
genotyping and the establishment of validation methods for the evaluation of
inferred genotypes."

"Background: Neuronal activity regulated by synaptic communication exerts an
important role in tumorigenesis and progression in brain tumors. Genes for
soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs)
annotated with the function 'vesicle' about synaptic connectivity were
identified, and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), one of those
proteins, was found to have discrepant expression levels in neuropathies.
However, the specific mechanism and prognostic value of SNAP25 during glioma
progression remain unclear.
Methods: Using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, 
the differential synaptosis-related genes between low grade glioma (LGG) and
glioblastoma (GBM) were identified as highly correlated. Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis and survival analysis were used to differentiate the outcome 
of low- and high-risk patients, and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohort
was used for validation of the data set. RT-qPCR, western blot, and
immunohistochemistry assays were performed to examine the expression level of
SNAP25 in glioma cells and samples. Functional assays were performed to identify 
the effects of SNAP25 knockdown and overexpression on cell viability, migration, 
and invasion. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry
(LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was presented for identifying crucial
metabolic disturbances in glioma cells. In situ mouse xenograft model was used to
investigate the role of SNAP25 in vivo. Then, an immunofluorescence assay of the 
xenograft tissue was applied to evaluate the expression of the neuronal dendron
formation marker-Microtubule Associated Protein 2 (MAP2).
Results: SNAP25 was decreased in level of expression in glioma tissues and cell
lines, and low-level SNAP25 indicated an unfavorable prognosis of glioma
patients. SNAP25 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and fostered
glutamine metabolism of glioma cells, exerting a tumor suppressor role.
Overexpressed SNAP25 exerted a lower expression level of MAP2, indicating poor
neuronal plasticity and connectivity. SNAP25 could regulate glutaminase
(GLS)-mediated glutaminolysis, and GLS knockdown could rescue the anti-tumor
effect of SNAP25 in glioma cells. Moreover, upregulated SNAP25 also decreased
tumor volume and prolonged the overall survival (OS) of the xenograft mouse.
Conclusion: SNAP25, a tumor suppressor inhibited carcinogenesis of glioma via
limiting glutamate metabolism by regulating GLS expression, as well as inhibiting
dendritic formation, which could be considered as a novel molecular therapeutic
target for glioma."

"Interest in human and experimental animal metabolism of substrates containing an 
odd number of carbons capable of fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle such as
heptanoic acid has motivated us to develop and validate a selective and specific 
liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous,
quantitative determination of the ketone body byproducts 3-hydroxypentanoic acid 
and 3-oxopentanoic acid in plasma. Human plasma samples were protein-precipitated
with methanol containing 0.2% formic acid. Chromatographic resolution was
achieved on a Phenomenex Luna C18 column using gradient elution with mobile
phases of water containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic
acid at 0.3 mL/min flow rate. The retention times of 3-hydroxypentanoic acid,
3-oxopentanoic acid and sulbactam (internal standard) were 3.85, 4.23, and
5.11 min, respectively. Validation was conducted in accordance with United States
Food and Drug Administration guidance. The validated range of 3-hydroxypentanoic 
acid was 0.078-5 µg/mL and 0.156-10 µg/mL for 3-oxopentanoic acid. The method was
accurate and precise over this range and exhibited 10-fold dilution integrity in 
human plasma. Recovery> 88% was achieved for analytes and internal standard.
There was no matrix effect observed in human plasma. Both 3-hydroxypentanoic acid
and 3-oxopentanoic acid were stable across conditions including autosampler,
benchtop and freeze-thaw, as well as demonstrated long-term stability at -80 °C. 
The method was applied to the measurement of 3-hydroxypentanoic acid and
3-oxopentanoic acid concentrations in plasma from subjects receiving the
triglyceride triheptanoin (as a source of heptanoate) for the experimental
treatment of glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) syndrome."

"The first multiple stable isotope dilution assay method was developed for the
simultaneous determination of four cobalamins, namely, hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl), 
adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), methylcobalamin (MeCbl), and cyanocobalamin (CNCbl), 
in their native forms. The sample preparation was optimized with enzyme treatment
and immunoaffinity purification. The analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS using
respective 15N-labeled cobalamins as internal standards. Method validation
resulted in limits of detection ranging from 0.19 to 0.58 ng/g and limits of
quantification ranging from 0.68 to 1.73 ng/g. Recoveries at three levels were
between 82 and 121%. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were below 6% and 11%
RSD, respectively. The analysis of a reference material resulted in a variance of
<1% from the certified value. The newly developed method demonstrated excellent
sensitivity, recovery, accuracy, and reproducibility and was further applied to
quantitate the four cobalamins in various meats."

"Monoclonal antibodies bind to Protein A/G resin with 100 nm-diameter pores, which
orients the Fab toward the reaction solution. Then, they can be proteolyzed using
trypsin immobilized on the surface of 200 nm-diameter nanoparticles. The
difference between the two particle diameters allows Fab-selective proteolysis by
limiting trypsin access to the antibody substrate. The specific signature peptide
of monoclonal antibody is collected, which comprises the
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Excess trypsin protease and peptide
fragments from common sequences in Fc that inhibit the analysis can then be
separated and removed. The resulting peptide samples are separated through high
performance liquid chromatography on a 20 nm-diameter pore-size reversed-phase
C18 column. These are then sequentially ionized with an electrospray interface
and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS). In MS, peptide ions are trapped and
fragment ions are generated by the collision-induced dissociation with argon gas.
These are detected with multiple reaction monitoring measurements to perform a
highly sensitive and accurate quantitative analysis.By focusing on various
physicochemical features at each analytical scene, such as characteristic
structure and orientation of antibody, control of trypsin reaction field,
carry-over on HPLC column, ionization suppression effect from endogenous
proteins, and detection of amino acid sequence specificity of antibody, we
optimized the overall conditions from the sample processing up to MS detection
and developed analytical validation and clinical application of many therapeutic 
antibodies using our Fab-selective proteolysis technology that is based on the
structure-indicated approach."

"BACKGROUND: Urine and plasma biomarker testing for lysosomal storage disorders by
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) currently requires multiple
analytical methods to detect the abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides,
mucopolysaccharides, and glycolipids. To improve clinical testing efficiency, we 
developed a single LC-MS method to simultaneously identify disorders of
oligosaccharide, mucopolysaccharide, and glycolipid metabolism with minimal
sample preparation.
METHODS: We created a single chromatographic method for separating free glycans
and glycolipids in their native form, using an amide column and high pH
conditions. We used this glycomic profiling method both in untargeted analyses of
patient and control urines using LC ion-mobility high-resolution MS (biomarker
discovery), and targeted analyses of urine, serum, and dried blood spot samples
by LC-MS/MS (clinical validation).
RESULTS: Untargeted glycomic profiling revealed twenty biomarkers that could
identify and subtype mucopolysaccharidoses. We incorporated these with known
oligosaccharide and glycolipid biomarkers into a rapid test that identifies at
least 27 lysosomal storage disorders, including oligosaccharidoses,
mucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses, glycogen storage disorders, and
congenital disorders of glycosylation and de-glycosylation. In a validation set
containing 115 urine samples from patients with lysosomal storage disorders, all 
were unambiguously distinguished from normal controls, with correct disease
subtyping for 88% (101/115) of cases. Glucosylsphingosine was reliably elevated
in dried blood spots from Gaucher disease patients with baseline resolution from 
galactosylsphingosine.
CONCLUSION: Glycomic profiling by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
identifies a range of lysosomal storage disorders. This test can be used in
clinical evaluations to rapidly focus a diagnosis, as well as to clarify or
support additional gene sequencing and enzyme studies."

"The complex and multifactorial nature of neuropsychiatric diseases demands
multi-target drugs that can intervene with various sub-pathologies underlying
disease progression. Targeting the impairments in cholinergic and glutamatergic
neurotransmissions with small molecules has been suggested as one of the
potential disease-modifying approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tacrine, a
potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the first FDA approved drug
for the treatment of AD. Tacrine is also a low affinity antagonist of
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). However, tacrine was withdrawn from its
clinical use later due to its hepatotoxicity. With an aim to develop novel high
affinity multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) against AChE and NMDAR, with
reduced hepatotoxicity, we performed in silico structure-based modifications on
tacrine, chemical synthesis of the derivatives and in vitro validation of their
activities. Nineteen such derivatives showed inhibition with IC50 values in the
range of 18.53 ± 2.09 - 184.09 ± 19.23 nM against AChE and 0.27 ± 0.05 -
38.84 ± 9.64 μM against NMDAR. Some of the selected compounds also protected rat 
primary cortical neurons from glutamate induced excitotoxicity. Two of the
tacrine derived MTDLs, 201 and 208 exhibited in vivo efficacy in rats by
protecting against behavioral impairment induced by administration of the
excitotoxic agent, monosodium glutamate. Additionally, several of these
synthesized compounds also exhibited promising inhibitory activitiy against
butyrylcholinesterase. MTDL-201 was also devoid of hepatotoxicity in vivo. Given 
the therapeutic potential of MTDLs in disease-modifying therapy, our studies
revealed several promising MTDLs among which 201 appears to be a potential
candidate for immediate preclinical evaluations."

"BACKGROUND: Trazodone (TZD) is a tetracyclic serotonin antagonist and reuptake
inhibitor that is used as a second-generation phenylpiperazine antidepressant.
However, the plasma concentrations of TZD have shown individual variations in
clinical practice. Quantification of TZD plasma concentrations may be an
effective and valuable method to balance the clinical efficacy and adverse
reactions. This study aimed to establish a novel LC-MS assay for measuring TZD
concentrations in human plasma for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
METHODS: After protein precipitation with acetonitrile, LC-MS quantification of
TZD was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with chromatographic
separation using a mobile phase of MeOH and 0.1% formic acid in water. This
method validation intends to investigate specificity, sensitivity, linearity,
precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, and stability according to USFDA
guidelines.
RESULTS: This method showed good selectivity because no interfering peaks were
observed in the plasma samples during the 2-min run time. The range of the
calibration curve was 1-3000 ng/mL. The detection and quantification limits were 
0.3 and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracies were
96.5-103.4%, with precision RSD% values of <5%, except for the limit of quality. 
The mean TZD recovery from human plasma was 95.4-104.5%. Finally, this method was
successfully applied to TDM in 20 patients. The TZD plasma concentrations of the 
patients ranged between 21.5 and 2267.3 ng/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel analytical method was established to measure TZD by LC-MS
coupled with an automatic 2-dimensional liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer
coupler 9500 (LC-MS/MS-Mate 9500), which is superior to the ordinary LC-MS system
in terms of separation, transport, anti-interference, sensitivity, and
quantitative analysis stability."

"Lefamulin (Xenleta®) is a first in-class systemic pleuromutilin antibiotic that
inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and selectively binds to a highly conserved 
region of the peptidyl transferase center of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit.
A total of twenty-five Phase 1 clinical studies, one Phase 2 study in acute
bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and two pivotal Phase 3
studies in adults with community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) have been
completed. Xenleta® (lefamulin) has been approved by the FDA on August 19, 2019, 
by Health Canada on July 10, 2020, and by the EMA on July 28, 2020 for the oral
and IV treatment of CABP in adults. For and during the clinical development,
simple, sensitive, precise, and selective LC-MS/MS methods were developed and
validated, first for lefamulin alone and later for the simultaneous
quantification of lefamulin and its main metabolite 2R-hydroxy lefamulin in human
plasma. Chromatographic separation in the current method was achieved on a
reverse phase C18 column using gradient elution at a flowrate of 500 μL/min
consisting of a mobile phase of water (A) and methanol (B) each containing 0.1 % 
formic acid (v/v) with a run time of 8.0 min. The detection and quantification of
the analytes were performed on AB Sciex Triple Quad 5500 using multiple reaction 
monitoring operated in positive electrospray ionization mode after a simple
plasma protein precipitation cleanup and dilution. The method was linear over the
concentration range of 1.00-1 000 ng/mL (r ≥ 0.999) for lefamulin und 1.00-500
ng/mL (r ≥ 0.999) for 2R-hydroxy lefamulin. No significant matrix effects and a
good extraction recovery were observed. The within- and between-run precision and
accuracy were within the acceptable limits, and both analytes were found to be
stable throughout the short term, long term, and freeze thaw stability studies.
This current validated method was successfully applied in five Phase 1 and two
Phase 3 studies."

"OBJECTIVES: Fat-soluble vitamins are measured to identify deficiencies that may
lead to rickets, osteomalacia, night blindness, and reversible motor and sensory 
neuropathies. We present a rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) method that simultaneously measures 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D3),
epi-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, vitamin A, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol.
METHODS: We mixed 100 µL serum with internal standard and extracted it by using
supported liquid extraction plates. Reconstituted specimens were analyzed by
LC-MS/MS with a 10-minute gradient.
RESULTS: The method was linear, covering physiological levels with r2 > 0.99, and
the total precision was less than 15% at all quality control levels. The lower
limit of the measuring intervals for 25(OH)D3, epi-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, vitamin A,
α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol were 4 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, 1 µg/dL, 0.2
µg/mL, and 0.2 µg/mL, respectively, with coefficient of variation of 20% or less.
Recoveries were between 92% and 111% for National Institute of Standards and
Technology reference materials and 81% and 122% for spike-recovery studies.
Comparison studies for vitamin D total, vitamin A, and α-tocopherol demonstrated 
slopes between 1.04 and 1.11 and r2 between 0.94 and 0.96. Minimal matrix effect 
was observed for all analytes.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a rapid LC-MS/MS method for the
simultaneous measurement of 25(OH)D3, epi-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, vitamin A,
α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol."

"Off-line combination of countercurrent separation (CCS) and quantitative 1H NMR
(qHNMR) methodologies enabled the systematic dissection and gravimetric
quantification of a chemically complex Rhodiola rosea crude extract (RCE). The
loss-free nature and high selectivity of CCS achieved the quantitative
discrimination of fatty acids (FAs), sugars, and proanthocyanidins (PACs) from
ten other metabolite classes: phenylpropanoids, phenylethanoids, acyclic
monoterpenoid glycosides, pinene derived glycosides, benzyl alcohol glycosides,
cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoids, gallic acids, methylparabens, and cuminol
glycosides. The ability of CCS to remove (""knockout"") PACs completely resolved
challenges with baselines that plague NMR and UHPLC analyses and produce
inaccurate integral and AUC quantitation, respectively. NMR analysis of the
non-PAC fractions enabled unambiguous identification of metabolites and their
characteristic resonances for subsequent multitarget absolute quantification by
qHNMR using a single, nonidentical internal calibrant (IC). An orthogonal
LC-MS/MS method validated the gravimetric nature of the CCS-qHNMR analytical
tandem. Underlying this LC-based cross-validation, comprehensive phytochemical
isolation and characterization established 19 single-compound reference standards
that represented all ten metabolite classes. Finally, quantum mechanical 1H
iterative Full Spin Analysis (HiFSA) of each standard provided a blueprint for
future structural dereplication, identification, and quantification of Rhodiola
marker constituents. The combination of two gravimetric analytical methods,
loss-free CCS and IC-qHNMR, realizes the first chemical standardization of a
botanical material that comprehensively captures a metabolome and permits
absolute quantification."

"The present study describes the selection of a sensitive multi-residue method
that can be used for the routine testing of pesticides in Kinnow Mandarin. The
citrate-buffered QuEChERS extraction followed by primary secondary amines and C18
clean-up was found suitable for the analysis of fifty four pesticides. The limit 
of quantification for the selected pesticides was lower than maximum residue
limits (MRLs) set by European Union, Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), and
twelve other countries. The method's accuracy ranged from 74.4 to 112% and
expanded uncertainty ranged from 7.5 to 49.6%. The validated method was applied
to Kinnow Mandarin samples, collected from 22 export units of district Sargodha, 
Pakistan. Almost 27% of the samples (n = 22) were exceeding the CAC-MRLs. The
index of quality for residues (IqR), for 64% of the samples, was considered
adequate. The study indicates the need for regular monitoring to protect public
health and ensure safe and consistent trade."

"This study aimed to develop an LC-MS/MS method for determining sildenafil and its
metabolites N-desmethylsildenafil and N1,N4-desmethylsildenafil in human plasma
and applying it to a pharmacokinetic study of sildenafil in healthy volunteers.
Sildenafil-d8 was used as the internal standard. Plasma samples were pretreated
via protein precipitation with acetonitrile. The extractives were then separated 
on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (50-mm × 2.1-mm, 1.7-μm) column using gradient
elution. The aqueous and organic mobile phases were ammonium formate 2 mM
supplemented with 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively, and
the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. An electrospray ionization source was applied, and 
multiple reaction monitoring was operated in the positive mode with selective
channels at m/z 475.30 → 100.10, 461.20 → 283.30, 483.30 → 108.10, and
449.00 → 283.00 for sildenafil, sildenafil-d8, N-desmethylsildenafil, and
N1,N4-desmethylsildenafil, respectively. The linear calibration curves of
sildenafil and its metabolites spanned 1.0-1000 ng/mL. The lower limit of
quantification was 1.0 ng/mL. The extractive recovery of analytes from the
biological matrix was more than 90% and the matrix effect complied with relevant 
provisions. The intra- and inter-day precisions of sildenafil and its metabolite 
were <10%. The intra- and inter-day accuracy of sildenafil,
N-desmethylsildenafil, and N1,N4-desmethylsildenafil was more than 99%. The
method is highly sensitive and selective, and it was successfully applied to the 
bioequivalence studies of 100-mg sildenafil citrate tablets in 40 healthy Chinese
volunteers."

"BACKGROUND: Until now, there is no method available for analysis of pesticide
residues in complex matrices like spices. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
develop and validate a QuEChERS-based method for the estimation of 104 pesticides
in cumin seed.
RESULTS: Samples were spiked for 109 pesticides at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and
1.0 mg kg-1 . Of these 104 pesticides were recovered. At 0.1, 0.5 and 0.1 mg kg-1
, recoveries ranged from 71% to 108% when compared with matrix matched standards.
Seventeen pesticides showed higher or lower recoveries than acceptable range
(70-120%) when quantified using solvent standards showing significant matrix
effect (ME) (≥ ±20%) even after 20× dilution. However, for the other pesticides
ME was significantly eliminated on dilution. The recovery percentage improved for
all pesticides on quantitation with matrix matched standards when compared with
solvent standards. For pesticides with lower European Union (EU) maximum residue 
limits (MRLs), an experiment at lower spiking concentrations of 0.01 and
0.05 mg kg-1 with lower dilutions (8×) reveals that almost all pesticides with
lower EU MRLs (0.02 and 0.05 mg kg-1 ) showed recoveries in the range 74-124% and
relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 20%.
CONCLUSION: Theoretical limit of quantitation (LOQ) is proposed which ranged from
0.01 to 0.18 mg kg-1 for matrix matched standards. An LOQ of 0.01 mg kg-1 was
easily achieved for the pesticides with lower EU MRLs with lower dilutions (8×)
with exception of fipronil for which this can be achieved without dilution
provided matrix matched standards are used. The method can be extended to other
spices. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."

"BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole and atorvastatin are often used jointly in the clinic.
The drug-drug interaction of pantoprazole and atorvastatin is worthy of being
investigated.
OBJECTIVE: A highly rapid, sensitive, and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed
for simultaneous quantification of pantoprazole and atorvastatin in rat plasma.
METHODS: Omeprazole and atorvastatin-d5 were used as the internal standards (ISs)
of pantoprazole and atorvastatin, respectively. Simple protein precipitation was 
used to extract analytes from 50.0 μL plasma samples.
RESULTS: The chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column and the
total chromatographic run time was 3.2 min. Acquisition of mass spectrometric
data was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple-
reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode with an ESI source using the transition m/z 384→
200 for pantoprazole and m/z 559.4→ 440.2 for atorvastatin, respectively. The
method was validated over the concentration range of 20.0 ∼ 5000 ng/mL for
pantoprazole and 1.00 ∼ 250 ng/mL for atorvastatin. All the validation results,
including linearity, specificity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery,
matrix effect, and stability, met the acceptance criteria as per FDA guidelines.
CONCLUSION: This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic interaction
study in Wistar rats. The results revealed significant evidence for the drug-drug
interaction between pantoprazole and atorvastatin."

"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress underlies a variety of disorders involving
inflammation, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases. Guanabenz acetate
(Wytensin®, GA), a clinically approved antihypertensive drug, efficiently
counteracts ER stress. The entirety of clinically used GA is the E-isomer, while 
the Z-isomer is known to lack significant hypotensive properties. We recently
discovered that the Z-isomer retains anti-ER stress activity. Coupled with its
lack of sedative effects, (Z)-GA is well positioned as a potential therapeutic
for a host of ER stress-related disorders. We set forth to characterize the
metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) of (Z)-GA in vitro and in vivo. Toward
this end, a reliable and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination
of the (E)- and (Z)-guanabenz was developed. Chromatographic separation of the
isomers was achieved on a C18 reverse phase column with a gradient elution.
Tandem mass spectrometric detection was conducted using an AB Sciex 5500 QTrap
mass spectrometer with positive electrospray ionization. Full validation of the
method was performed in mouse plasma with a simple and low plasma volume protein 
precipitation procedure. The method demonstrated good linearity, reproducibility,
and accuracy over a range of 0.5-1000 nM with minimal matrix effect and excellent
extraction efficiency. In addition, the developed method was successfully applied
to DMPK studies of the GA isomers in vitro and in vivo. Results of these studies 
revealed for the first time that the DMPK profile of (Z)-guanabenz is distinct
from that of (E)-guanabenz, with higher apparent volume of distribution (Vd) and 
clearance, presumably due to lower plasma protein binding."

"BACKGROUND: Elabela/Toddler (ELA) is a novel endogenous ligand of the apelin
receptor, whose signalling has emerged as a therapeutic target, for example, in
cardiovascular disease and cancer. Shorter forms of ELA-32 have been predicted,
including ELA-21 and ELA-11, but metabolism and stability of ELA-32 in humans is 
poorly understood. We, therefore, developed an LC-MS/MS assay to identify ELA-32 
metabolites in human plasma and tissues.
METHOD: Human kidney homogenates or plasma were incubated at 37 °C with ELA-32
and aliquots withdrawn over 2-4 h into guanidine hydrochloride. Proteins were
precipitated and supernatant solid-phase extracted. Peptides were extracted from 
coronary artery, brain and kidney by immunoprecipitation or solid-phase
extraction following acidification. All samples were reduced and alkylated before
analysis on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer in high and nano flow mode.
RESULTS: The half-life of ELA-32 in plasma and kidney were 47.2 ± 5.7 min and
44.2 ± 3 s, respectively. Using PEAKS Studio and manual data analysis, the most
important fragments of ELA-32 with potential biological activity identified were 
ELA-11, ELA-16, ELA-19 and ELA-20. The corresponding fragments resulting from the
loss of C-terminal amino acids were also identified. Endogenous levels of these
peptides could not be measured, as ELA peptides are prone to oxidation and poor
chromatographic peaks.
CONCLUSIONS: The relatively long ELA plasma half-life observed and identification
of a potentially more stable fragment, ELA-16, may suggest that ELA could be a
better tool compound and novel template for the development of new drugs acting
at the apelin receptor."

"Epilepsy is a widely diffused neurological disorder including a heterogeneous
range of syndromes with different aetiology, severity and prognosis.
Pharmacological treatments are based on the use, either in mono- or in
polytherapy, of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which act at different synaptic
levels, generally modifying the excitatory and/or inhibitory response through
different action mechanisms. To reduce the risk of adverse effects and drug
interactions, ASMs levels should be closely evaluated in biological fluids
performing an appropriate Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM). However, many
decisions in TDM are based on the determination of the total drug concentration
although measurement of the free fraction, which is not bound to plasma proteins,
is becoming of ever-increasing importance since it correlates better with
pharmacological and toxicological effects. Aim of this work has been to review
methodological aspects concerning the evaluation of the free plasmatic fraction
of some ASMs, focusing on the effect and the clinical significance that
drug-protein binding has in the case of widely used drugs such as valproic acid, 
phenytoin, perampanel and carbamazepine. Although several validated methodologies
are currently available which are effective in separating and quantifying the
different forms of a drug, prospective validation studies are undoubtedly needed 
to better correlate, in real-world clinical contexts, pharmacokinetic monitoring 
to clinical outcomes."

"BACKGROUND: Different liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
methods have been published for quantification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in
plasma but thus far none allowed the simultaneous quantification of several mAbs,
including immune checkpoint inhibitors. We developed and validated an original
multiplex LC-MS/MS method using a ready-to-use kit to simultaneously assay 7 mAbs
(i.e., bevacizumab, cetuximab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, rituximab
and trastuzumab) in plasma. This method was next cross-validated with respective 
reference methods (ELISA or LC-MS/MS).
METHODS: The mAbXmise kit was used for mAb extraction and full-length
stable-isotope-labeled antibodies as internal standards. The LC-MS/MS method was 
fully validated following current EMA guidelines. Each cross validation between
reference methods and ours included 16-28 plasma samples from cancer patients.
RESULTS: The method was linear from 2 to 100 µg/mL for all mAbs. Inter- and
intra-assay precision was <14.6% and accuracy was 90.1-111.1%. The mean absolute 
bias of measured concentrations between multiplex and reference methods was 10.6%
(range 3.0-19.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and cross-validated a simple, accurate and precise
method that allows the assay of up to 7 mAbs. Furthermore, the present method is 
the first to offer a simultaneous quantification of three immune checkpoint
inhibitors likely to be associated in patients."

"RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the potential biomarkers for peritoneal endometriosis
in peritoneal fluid and serum?
DESIGN: Case-control studies composed of independent discovery and validation
sets were conducted. In the discovery set, untargeted liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, multivariable and univariable analyses were
conducted to generate global metabolomic profiles of peritoneal fluid for
endometriosis and to identify potential metabolites that could distinguish
peritoneal endometriosis (n = 10) from controls (n = 31). The identified
metabolites from the discovery set were validated in independent peritoneal fluid
(n =19 peritoneal endometriosis and n = 20 controls) and serum samples (n = 16
peritoneal endometriosis and n = 19 controls) using targeted metabolomics. The
area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) analysis was used
to evaluate the diagnostic performance of peritoneal endometriosis metabolites.
RESULTS: In the discovery set, peritoneal fluid phosphatidylcholine (34:3) and
phenylalanyl-isoleucine were significantly increased in peritoneal endometriosis 
groups compared with control groups, with AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.92;
P = 0.018) and AUC 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02; P < 0.001), respectively. In the
validation set, phenylalanyl-isoleucine retained discriminatory performance to
distinguish peritoneal endometriosis from controls in both peritoneal fluid (AUC 
0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; P = 0.006) and serum samples (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to
0.99; P = 0.004), with notably stronger discrimination between peritoneal
endometriosis and controls in proliferative phase.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results propose phenylalanyl-isoleucine as a
potential biomarker of peritoneal endometriosis, which may be used as a minimally
invasive diagnostic biomarker of peritoneal endometriosis."

"Orexins are two neuropeptides synthesised mainly in the brain lateral
hypothalamic area. The orexinergic system provides arousal-dependent cues for a
plethora of brain centres, playing a vital role in feeding behaviour, regulation 
of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms. Recently, orexins were found to be
produced in the retina of an eye; however, their content in the vitreous body and
possible daily pattern of expression have not yet been explored. In this
manuscript, we describe the development and validation of a liquid chromatography
with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method designed for quantitative
bioanalysis of orexin in the rat vitreous body. Orexin was extracted from
vitreous body samples with a water:acetonitrile:formic acid (80:20:0.1; v/v/v)
mixture followed by vortexing and centrifuging. Separation was performed on a
reverse-phase HPLC column under gradient conditions. Orexin was analysed via
multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in the positive electrospray mode. The total
analysis time for each sample was less than 5.0 min. Once the method was fully
optimised, it was then validated, following the 2018 FDA guidance on
bioanalytical method validations. The calibration curves for orexin (1-500 ng/mL)
were constructed using a linear regression with a 1/x2 weighting. The lower limit
of quantitation for orexin was 1.0 pg/mL for the vitreous body. Intra-day and
inter-day estimates of accuracy and precision were within 10% of their nominal
values, indicating that the method is reliable for quantitation of orexin in the 
rat vitreous body. From the physiological perspective, our results are the first 
to show daily rhythm of orexin synthesis by the retina with possible implications
on the circadian regulation of vision."

"Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment modality for the local control of
breast cancer (BC). Unfortunately, not all patients that receive RT will obtain a
therapeutic benefit, as cancer cells that either possess intrinsic
radioresistance or develop resistance during treatment can reduce its efficacy.
For RT treatment regimens to become personalised, there is a need to identify
biomarkers that can predict and/or monitor a tumour's response to radiation. Here
we describe a novel method to identify such biomarkers. Liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used on conditioned media (CM)
samples from a radiosensitive oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC cell line
(MCF-7) to identify cancer-secreted biomarkers which reflected a response to
radiation. A total of 33 radiation-induced secreted proteins that had higher (up 
to 12-fold) secretion levels at 24 h post-2 Gy radiation were identified.
Secretomic results were combined with whole-transcriptome gene expression
experiments, using both radiosensitive and radioresistant cells, to identify a
signature related to intrinsic radiosensitivity. Gene expression analysis
assessing the levels of the 33 proteins showed that 5 (YBX3, EIF4EBP2, DKK1,
GNPNAT1 and TK1) had higher expression levels in the radiosensitive cells
compared to their radioresistant derivatives; 3 of these proteins (DKK1, GNPNAT1 
and TK1) underwent in-lab and initial clinical validation. Western blot analysis 
using CM samples from cell lines confirmed a significant increase in the release 
of each candidate biomarker from radiosensitive cells 24 h after treatment with a
2 Gy dose of radiation; no significant increase in secretion was observed in the 
radioresistant cells after radiation. Immunohistochemistry showed that higher
intracellular protein levels of the biomarkers were associated with greater
radiosensitivity. Intracellular levels were further assessed in pre-treatment
biopsy tissues from patients diagnosed with ER+ BC that were subsequently treated
with breast-conserving surgery and RT. High DKK1 and GNPNAT1 intracellular levels
were associated with significantly increased recurrence-free survival times,
indicating that these two candidate biomarkers have the potential to predict
sensitivity to RT. We suggest that the methods highlighted in this study could be
utilised for the identification of biomarkers that may have a potential clinical 
role in personalising and optimising RT dosing regimens, whilst limiting the
administration of RT to patients who are unlikely to benefit."

"Even though antibiotics are necessary in livestock production, they can be
harmful not only due to their toxicity, but also in view of their contribution to
the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Screening tests based on microbial
growth inhibition appeared to be useful tools to prevent its entry into the food 
chain. They have nevertheless been traditionally carried out post mortem, leading
to great economical loss and harm to the environment in case a positive sample is
found. Hence, the objective was to evaluate the use of a screening test as an
ante mortem alternative for the detection of antibiotic residues in meat: thus,
Explorer®-Blood test was optimized and validated. After adapting the procedure
for matrix preparation, the assay parameters were assessed from 344
antibiotic-free blood serum samples. Limits of Detection (LoDs) were defined by
spiking blood serum with several of the most common antimicrobials used in
veterinary practice. LoDs were similar to those obtained for meat and were at or 
below the maximum residue limits set by EU legislation for muscle. Analyses of in
vivo injected samples, previously characterized by LC-MS/MS, demonstrated the
method's accuracy and proved that Explorer®-Blood can be considered a suitable
alternative to conventional post mortem screening methods."

"Bortezomib, a proteinase inhibitor currently used to treat multiple myeloma and
mantle cell lymphoma, has a high incidence of adverse reactions and large
inter-individual differences in plasma concentrations. A simple, validated
LC-MS/MS method for the quantitative analysis of bortezomib in dried blood spot
(DBS) samples was developed to provide support for determining the effective
concentration range of bortezomib for clinical use. Fifty (i50) μL of spiked
blood were added onto Whatman protein saver cards to prepare the DBS samples.
Circular cards of 6 mm diameter were punched, extracted by methanol containing
the internal standard (apatinib), and injected into the LC-MS/MS system. The
method validation included selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision,
stability, matrix effect, recovery and hematocrit. The calibration curve showed
correlation coefficient values higher than 0.999 in the range of 0.2 - 20.0 ng/mL
for bortezomib. The acceptance criteria of accuracy (relative error < 12.5%) and 
precision (coefficient of variation < 10.7%) were met in all cases. The matrix
effect was<13.2%, and the recovery was between 87.3 and 100.2%. DBS samples were 
shown to be stable when stored in cold conditions or at room temperature.
Different hematocrit values did not significantly affect the accuracy of the
measured concentrations. And there are no significant differences between
bortezomib concentrations in DBS samples and plasma samples. This new method was 
successfully used for clinical concentration determinations of bortezomib and can
be applied in future therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of
bortezomib especially in pediatric patients."

"In forensic toxicology, amphetamine intoxications represent one of the most
common case groups and present difficult questions for toxicologists. Estimating 
the time of consumption and the current influence of the stimulant is
particularly difficult when only total amphetamine concentrations are considered.
Stereoselective analysis and the consideration of metabolites can provide
valuable information to facilitate interpretation. An enantioselective liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for detection of
amphetamine, norephedrine and 4-hydroxyamphetamine was developed. Validation
showed satisfactory selectivity, sensitivity, linearity (0.5-250 ng/mL),
precision and accuracy for all enantiomers. The method was applied to a
collective of 425 forensic serum samples and 30 serum samples from psychiatric
inpatients stating their last time of amphetamine consumption. Norephedrine and
4-hydroxyamphetamine were detected more frequently at higher amphetamine
concentrations and at lower amphetamine (R)/(S) concentration ratios, possibly
indicating recent consumption. Mean (R)/(S) ratio of amphetamine was 1.14,
whereas higher ratios (mean 1.36) were found for amphetamine concentrations below
100 ng/mL. The (R)/(S) ratios of psychiatric inpatients significantly correlated 
with the reported time intervals to last consumption. The use of amphetamine
(R)/(S) ratios and the simultaneous detection of metabolites are promising
factors that can facilitate estimation of consumption time and current
impairment."

"We aimed to investigate whether retinal and retinoic acid (RA), which are newly
discovered biomarkers from our previous research, reliably predict type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development in subjects with impaired fasting glucose
(IFG). Among the Korean Cancer Prevention Study (KCPS)-II cohort, subjects were
selected and matched by age and sex (IFG-IFG group, n = 100 vs. IFG-DM group, n =
100) for study 1. For real-world validation of two biomarkers (study 2), other
participants in the KCPS-II cohort who had IFG at baseline (n = 500) were
selected. Targeted LC/MS was used to analyze the baseline serum samples; retinal 
and RA levels were quantified. In study 1, we revealed that both biomarkers were 
significantly decreased in the IFG-DM group (retinal, p = 0.017; RA, p < 0.001). 
The obese subjects in the IFG-DM group showed markedly lower retinal (p = 0.030) 
and RA (p = 0.003) levels than those in the IFG-IFG group. In study 2, the
results for the two metabolites tended to be similar to those of study 1, but no 
significant difference was observed. Notably, the predictive ability for T2DM was
enhanced when the metabolites were added to conventional risk factors for T2DM in
both studies (study 1, AUC 0.682 → 0.775; study 2, AUC 0.734 → 0.786). The
results suggest that retinal- and RA-related metabolic pathways are altered
before the onset of T2DM."

"Previously published methods for the analysis of metaldehyde were adapted for its
reliable quantification in soil extracts. Varied methanol-water extraction
solvents were trialed, but the use of pure methanol proved to be the most
reliable approach for the scaled down methodology. Analysis of metaldehyde was
done using LC-MS. Initially the method had problems with matrix suppression of
the signal. The method was therefore further developed to overcome this challenge
to avoid the costs and time demands of laborious clean-up protocols. This
modification to the method involved use of the BEH Phenyl column instead of the
C18 column initially used, and optimization of the gradient flow of the mobile
phase. The optimized LC-MS method was validated and used for further research
applications. In brief,•We investigated the recovery of metaldehyde from spiked
soil samples.•The optimized LC-MS method achieved acceptable metaldehyde
recoveries (100-132%, 109% on average) for a range of soil types.•The optimized
method was suitable for high through-put analyzes."

"Highly polar pesticides are frequently used in agriculture. However, their
physicochemical properties make very difficult the analysis of these compounds
following common procedures. Polar pesticides show poor retention and peak shapes
in the common stationary phases used for multiresidue methods of pesticides. For 
this reason, multiple columns with different stationary phases have been
developed to perform the analysis of these particular compounds. The column
evaluated in this method uses a new hybrid stationary phase with a mixed-mode
between hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and ion exchange
interactions. The retention modes are dependant on mobile phase conditions and
can be easily switched. The aim of this study can be summarized in the next
bullet points: • Performance evaluation of 10 anionic compounds in different
column sizes of the hybrid stationary phase. • Validation of the method in terms 
of sensitivity, linearity, and matrix effects in four different matrices: tomato,
orange, onion and quince. • Improvement of the retention time robustness."

"Treated wastewater is currently used in the agricultural sector to solve the lack
of availability of freshwater in many regions. However, reclaimed water can
contain multiclass of organic contaminants. Therefore, the soil can become a
reservoir of agricultural (e.g. pesticides) and urban (e.g. pharmaceuticals)
contaminants. Consequently, the evaluation of this contamination process is
necessary for assessing its potential human and environmental negative effects.
Due to the low concentration levels, different chemical properties and the
complexity of the matrix, an efficient sample preparation step for achieving
adequate sensitivity and robust analysis in the soil is needed. The aim of this
study was to develop a quick and easy extraction method based on a QuEChERS
procedure for the determination of 27 organic contaminants in agricultural soil
samples. The procedure was based on a salting-out extraction with acidified
acetonitrile, followed by a dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE). A liquid
chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system was applied for the
determination and quantification of the selected target analytes. The main
benefits of this analytical approach are:•Reduction/elimination of majority of
the interferences improving the sensitivity of the method.•Robust simultaneous
determination of a multiclass of organic contaminants with very different
physicochemical properties."

"We present concise results of method validation for trehalose quantitation by
LC-MS/MS in spruce ectomycorrhizal roots in order to describe spruce health
status, mainly in connection to contamination by a pathogenic fungus, Gemmamyces 
piceae. The procedure is based on Rogatsky et al. (2005) developed for human
plasma. We found out that the best extraction yield was achieved with 80%
methanol/water (v/v) solution and optimal extraction temperature was set between 
50-60°C. In contrast to previous papers, we minimized the activity of trehalase
enzyme by putting root samples into liquid N2 immediately after root excavation, 
followed by freeze-drying in order to stop trehalase activity. Higher content of 
trehalose was recorded in healthy trees, confirming the idea that ectomycorrhiza 
plays a significant role in plant-pathogen interactions."

"E-cigarette, or vaping, product (EVP) use has increased dramatically in the
United States over the last 4 years, particularly in youth and young adults.
Little information is available on the chemical contents of these products.
Typically, EVPs contain an active ingredient such as nicotine, CBD, or THC
dissolved in a suitable solvent that facilitates aerosol generation. One EVP
solvent, vitamin E acetate (VEA), has been measured in EVP liquids associated
with lung injury. However, no validated analytical methods for measuring VEA in
the aerosol from these devices was previously available. Therefore, we developed 
a high throughput isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method to simultaneously measure VEA 
and three other related tocopherols in aerosolized EVP samples. The assay was
precise, with VEA repeatability ranging from 4.0 to 8.3% and intermediate
precision ranging from 2.5 to 6.7%. Similar precision was obtained for the three 
other tocopherols measured. The LODs for the four analytes ranged from 8.85 ×
10-6 to 2.28 × 10-5 μg analyte per mL of aerosol puff volume, and calibration
curves were linear (R 2 > 0.99). This method was used to analyze aerosol
emissions of 147 EVPs associated with EVALI case patients. We detected VEA in 46%
of the case-associated EVPs with a range of 1.87 × 10-4-74.1 µg per mL of aerosol
puff volume and mean of 25.1 µg per mL of aerosol puff volume. Macro-levels of
VEA (>0.1% w/w total aerosol particulate matter) were not detected in nicotine or
cannabidiol (CBD) products; conversely 71% of the EVALI associated
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products contained macro-levels of VEA. Trace levels
of other tocopherol isoforms were detected at lower rates and concentrations
(α-tocopherol: 41% detected, mean 0.095 µg analyte per mL of aerosol puff volume;
γ-tocopherol: 5% detected, mean 0.0193 µg analyte per mL of aerosol puff volume; 
δ-tocopherol: not detected). Our results indicate that VEA can be efficiently
transferred to aerosol by EVALI-associated EVPs vaped using a standardized
protocol."

"Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) like amphetamine ('speed'), methamphetamine
('crystal meth') and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy')
represent some of the most frequently abused drugs worldwide. Another less
frequently abused ATS is 4-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA). The enantiomers of these
four compounds exhibit different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. 
According to the free drug theory, the pharmacological properties of a substance 
are dependent on its plasma protein binding (PPB). However, data on PPB of
stimulant enantiomers in humans are rare or non-existent. Human plasma samples
were spiked with racemic mixtures of the stimulants and subjected to
ultrafiltration to extract the unbound fraction. Enantioselective liquid
chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were applied using a
chiral Phenomenex® Lux3 μm AMP column. Method validation showed satisfactory
selectivity, linearity (0.5 250 ng/mL), accuracy and precision. Enantiomers were 
quantified before and after ultracentrifugation to determine PPB. For all
analytes, low to medium plasma protein binding was found. For (R)-amphetamine a
slightly but significantly higher PPB was found compared to the (S)-enantiomer
(31.7 % vs 29.0 %). (R)-MDMA also showed only slightly but significantly
significantly higher PPB than (S)-MDMA, although the mean difference was
negligible (21.6 % vs 21.3 %). For the enantiomers of methamphetamine and 4-FA,
no significant differences in PPB were found. In summary, there were no or only
minor differences in PBB for the enantiomers of all investigated compounds. The
different pharmacological properties of the stimulant enantiomers can therefore
not be explained by differences in PPB."

"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension can cause vascular function
impairment in offspring. In our previous work, we described the protein
expression profiles of umbilical artery tissues from patients with preeclampsia.
METHODS: To gain insights into the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in adult
rats born to preeclamptic dams, we analyzed thoracic aorta tissues by using iTRAQ
isobaric tags and 2D nano LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: By using the iTRAQ method, we analyzed 1825 proteins, of which 106
showed significantly different expression in the thoracic aortic. Ingenuity
pathway analysis (IPA) showed that the majority of differentially expressed
proteins (DEPs) were associated with cardiovascular function. Further analysis
indicated that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is inhibited by
miR-423-5p and activated by TP53, had the strongest effect on cardiovascular
function. The expression of G6PD was upregulated in thoracic aorta tissues, as
confirmed by Western blotting. The expression of two other vascular
function-related proteins, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) and
tubulin alpha-4 A (TUBA4A), was upregulated, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry
(MS).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the results require further functional validation, these
data provide novel findings related to vascular function impairment in the adult 
offspring of preeclamptic mothers."

"An on-line solid phase extraction using a lab-made restricted access media (RAM) 
was developed as sample preparation procedure for determination of the
pharmaceutical compounds caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CBZ), norfloxacin (NOR), 
ciprofloxacin (CIP), fluoxetine (FLX) and venlafaxine in wastewater treatment
plant samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This 
method is suitable for use in routine of analysis, avoiding cross-contamination
and requiring only a small sample volume (50 µL), with minimal handling. The
method was validated according to international guidelines. The chromatographic
efficiency was evaluated using peak resolution and asymmetry parameters.
Carryover was also evaluated, in order to ensure reliability of the analysis and 
the ability to reuse the cartridge. Satisfactory linearity (r2 > 0.99) was
obtained for all the compounds. The intra- and inter-day precision values were
lower than 5.79 and 14.1%, respectively. The limits of detection ranged from 0.01
to 3 µg L-1 and the limits of quantification were from 0.1 to 5 µg L-1. The
method was applied to 20 environmental wastewater samples, with caffeine being
the most widely detected compound, at the highest concentration of 392 µg L-1,
while other compounds were detected in fewer samples at lower concentrations (up 
to 9.60 µg L-1). The lab-made modification is a cheaper option for on-line sample
preparation, compared to commercially available on-line SPE cartridges and RAM
columns. Moreover, a high-throughput procedure was achieved, with an analysis
time of 16 min including sample preparation and chromatographic separation. The
same RAM column was applied over 200 injections including method optimization,
validation and application in wastewater samples without loss of analytical
response."

"Individualization of fosfomycin dosing based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
of plasma concentrations could reduce drug-related adverse events and improve
clinical outcome in complex clinical conditions. Quantification of fosfomycin in 
plasma samples was performed by a rapid ultraperformance liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry method. Sample preparation involved protein precipitation with 
[13C3]-fosfomycin benzylamine salt as internal standard. The calibration curve
ranged from 2 to 800 mg/L. Within- and between-day precision and accuracy,
sensitivity, selectivity, dilution integrity, recovery were investigated and the 
results met the acceptance criteria. In patients, multiple drug dosing (every 6
or 8 hours) or in continuous administration were adopted, resulting in a large
interpatient variability in drug concentrations (from 7.4 mg/L and 644.6 mg/L;
CV: 91.1%). In critical care patient setting TDM can represent an important tool 
to identify the best fosfomycin dosing in single patients, taking into
consideration clinical characteristics, infection sites and susceptibility of the
treated pathogens."

"Breast cancer clinical treatment selection is based on the immunohistochemical
determination of four protein biomarkers: ESR1, PGR, HER2, and MKI67. Our aim was
to correlate immunohistochemical results to proteome-level technologies in
measuring the expression of these markers. We also aimed to integrate available
proteome-level breast cancer datasets to identify and validate new prognostic
biomarker candidates. We searched studies involving breast cancer patient cohorts
with published survival and proteomic information. Immunohistochemistry and
proteomic technologies were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to validate discriminative 
power. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were calculated to
assess prognostic power. False Discovery Rate was computed to correct for
multiple hypothesis testing. We established a database integrating protein
expression data and survival information from four independent cohorts for 1229
breast cancer patients. In all four studies combined, a total of 7342 unique
proteins were identified, and 1417 of these were identified in at least three
datasets. ESR1, PGR, and HER2 protein expression levels determined by RPPA or
LC-MS/MS methods showed a significant correlation with the levels determined by
immunohistochemistry (p < 0.0001). PGR and ESR1 levels showed a moderate
correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.17, p = 0.0399). An additional panel of 
candidate proteins, including apoptosis-related proteins (BCL2,), adhesion
markers (CDH1, CLDN3, CLDN7) and basal markers (cytokeratins), were validated as 
prognostic biomarkers. Finally, we expanded our previously established web tool
designed to validate survival-associated biomarkers by including the proteomic
datasets analyzed in this study ( https://kmplot.com/ ). In summary, large
proteomic studies now provide sufficient data enabling the validation and ranking
of potential protein biomarkers."

"In the current study, a liquid chromatography coupled mass detector was set up to
detect and quantify 108 pesticide residues in rice samples. QuEChERS method was
applied for sample preparation and different validation parameters were
determined to ensure the suitability of the method. The calibration curves were
linear in the concentration 0.01-1.00 mg/kg with a coefficient of determination
(R2) of more than 0.990 for all compounds. Based on signal to noise studies, the 
calculated LODs and LOQs were 0.005-0.060 mg/kg and 0.018-0.199 mg/kg,
respectively; and acquired mean recoveries at three spiked levels (0.025, 0.200
and 0.800 mg/kg) were 72% - 117% with RSD < 20%. The developed method was used to
investigate the occurrence of the studied pesticides in 65 internal and 65
foreign rice samples. The results showed that 14 internal and 15 imported samples
were found to be contaminated 12 pesticides in the amounts between 0.027 mg/kg to
0.078 mg/kg and 0.031 mg/kg to 0.081 mg/kg, respectively. According to the
Iranian regulations, with the exception of nine prohibited pesticides for rice
production in Iran, bioallethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, flutriafol,
foramsulfuron, imazalil, phosphamidon, TCMTB, and triasulfuron, three permitted
pesticides, cinosulfuron, triadimenol, and tricyclazole, found in positive rice
samples were below MRLs established by Iranian National Standard Organization
(INSO)."

"The level of melatonin in human milk might be closely related to infant
development and the building up of their circadian rhythms. The large population 
investigation on this topic would provide insights for the prevention and
treatment of diseases related to early development and circadian rhythms.
However, it has not been well studied. Trace level endogenous melatonin and
difficulties in sample collection are among the challenges limiting the progress.
High throughput analytical method with high specificity and sensitivity to
determine the endogenous melatonin concentration is highly desired. A newly
developed easily operated and high-throughput sensitive on-line enrichment liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method would be reported in
this paper. Melatonin-d3 (MEL-d3) was used as a surrogate standard for the
calibration curve and melatonin-d4 (MEL-d4) was used as an internal standard.
Sample preparation was simply performed in 96-well plate by protein precipitation
using acetonitrile (ACN). The supernatant was injected directly into the easily
configured LC-MS/MS system with an enlarged sample loop and a mixer. Positive
mode multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was adopted for the measurement of
melatonin in milk. 100 μL sample was used for analysis and the calibration curve 
linear range was 1-1000 pg mL-1. In three validation batches, the accuracy was
within 11.0% deviation from the relative nominal concentration, whereas the
intra- and inter-assay precision was ≤4.1% and ≤6.8% relative standard deviation 
(RSD), respectively. Although matrix effect was observed in the validation
experiments, the stable isotope labeled internal standard (MEL-d4) could correct 
it and the overall relative matrix effect of MEL-d3/MEL-d4 was close to 100%. The
overall spike recovery of the method was 101.7% with 5.1% RSD. Compared to
currently reported methods, it could reach 1 pg mL-1 lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) with a smaller sample volume, sample preparation could be
easily performed by automated liquid handling system and was more suitable for
large population cohort studies on trace level endogenous melatonin
determination."

"One potential unknown impurity was detected during the analysis of stability
batches of brimonidine tartrate (BMT) in the level ranging from 0.03 % to 0.06 % 
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Based on the liquid
chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS) analysis, the unknown impurity
structure was presumed as 3,6,11,13,16-pentaazatetracyclo [8.6.0.0²,⁷.0¹²,¹⁶]
hexadeca-1,3,5,7,9,12-hexaene. The proposed structure was elucidated, after its
isolation using preparative liquid chromatography from the impurity enriched
reaction crude sample, using analytical applications such as 1D NMR (1H, 13C and 
DEPT-135), 2D NMR (HMBC and COSY), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and
infrared spectroscopy (IR). The unknown impurity was prepared from brimonidine by
following Ullman coupling reaction in the presence of CuBr2 in gram scale with
optimum purity to use further in analytical developments. The identification,
structural elucidation and synthesis of unknown degradation impurity such as
BMT-cyclized impurity, and HPLC method validation were reported for the first
time in this paper."

"OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to develop a validated LC-MS / MS method for the
measurement of carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) levels, to
compare the carbamazepine concentrations measured by AbSciex API 3200 LC-MS/MS
and Beckman Coulter Emit® 2000 immunoassay and to investigate the effect of
carbamazepine concentrations on various hematological and biochemical parameters.
METHODS: For the measurement of carbamazepine and CBZE levels, a validated LC-MS 
/ MS method was developed. Serum carbamazepine levels of patients were measured
by AbSciex API 3200 LC-MS / MS and Beckman Coulter Emit® 2000 immunoassay.
Biochemical, hematological parameters, and hormone levels were measured by
Beckman-Coulter AU 5800 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), Beckman Coulter LH 780
(Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), and Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany)
analyzers, respectively.
RESULTS: The imprecision values for all analytes were less than 7.0 %. The
correlation coefficient between the methods was 0.981 (95 % confidence interval: 
0.975 to 0.985). Linear regression analysis demonstrated highly significant
associations of carbamazepine concentrations with albumin (B = -0.300, p =
0.040), calcium (B = -0.262, p = 0.004), phosphorus (B = -0.241, p = 0.022), WBC 
(B = -0.288, p = <0.001), PLT (B = -0.236, p = 0.003), RBC (B = -0.257, p =
0.001), NEU% (B = -0.289, p = <0.001), LYM% (B = -0.268, p = 0.001), D vitamini
(B = -0.344, p = 0.006) levels.
CONCLUSIONS: A robust, rapid, and simple method has been developed. Our study
revealed that carbamazepine and its metabolite have a significant correlation and
likely impact on bone metabolism, blood cell counts, serum protein, albumin
levels, and electrolyte concentrations."

"Recent research regarding amino acid metabolism has shown that there may be a
link between obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work reports a
metabolomics study using targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based
metabolomic strategies to investigate this link. Targeted hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and untargeted
reversed-phase liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry
assays were developed to analyze the metabolic changes that occur in AD and
obesity. APPSwe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PSEN1) transgenic mice (to represent familial or
early-onset AD) and wild-type littermate controls were fed either a high-fat diet
(HFD, 60% kcal from lard) or a low-fat diet (LFD, 10% kcal from lard) from 2
months of age or a reversal diet (HFD, followed by LFD from 9.5 months). For
targeted analyses, we applied the guidelines outlined in the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) LC-MS C62-A document and the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) bioanalytical method validation guidance for industry
to evaluate the figures of merit of the assays. Our targeted and untargeted
metabolomics results suggest that numerous peripheral pathways, specifically
amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, were significantly affected by
AD and diet. Multiple amino acids (including alanine, glutamic acid, leucine,
isoleucine, and phenylalanine), carnitines, and members of the fatty acid
oxidation pathway were significantly increased in APP/PSEN1 mice on HFD compared 
to those on LFD. More substantial effects and changes were observed in the
APP/PSEN1 mice than in the WT mice, suggesting that they were more sensitive to
an HFD. These dysregulated peripheral pathways include numerous amino acid
pathways and fatty acid beta oxidation and suggest that obesity combined with AD 
further enhances cognitive impairment, possibly through aggravated mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Furthermore, partial reversibility of many altered pathways was
observed, which highlights that diet change can mitigate the metabolic effects of
AD. The same trends in individual amino acids were observed in both strategies,
highlighting the biological validity of the results."

"A simple, fast and precise LC-MS/MS method for the quantitation of the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor gilteritinib was developed and validated for micro-volumes of
mouse plasma. The assay procedure involved a one-step extraction of gilteritinib 
and the internal standard [2H5]-gilteritinib with acetonitrile. An Accucore aQ
column was used to separate analytes using a gradient elution delivered at a flow
rate of 0.4 mL/min, and a total run time of 2.5 min. Validation studies with
quality control samples processed on consecutive days revealed that values for
intra-day and inter-day precision were <7.04%, with an accuracy of 101-108%.
Linear responses were observed over the entire calibration curve range (up to
500 ng/mL), and the lower limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL. The developed
method was successfully used to examine the pharmacokinetics of oral gilteritinib
in wild-type mice and mice lacking the organic cation transporters OCT1, OCT2,
and MATE1 to further understand mechanisms contributing to drug-drug interactions
and causes of inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability."

"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an established tool to analyse patterns of
community drug use. In recent times, monitoring the use of analgesics has become 
a public health priority. An analytical method was developed, optimised and
validated for a broad range of common analgesics (non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories and opioids) and their metabolites at trace concentrations in
wastewater influent. Samples were analysed via liquid chromatography coupled to
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) 
in both positive and negative ion multiple reaction monitoring modes. Fifteen of 
the thirty-five biomarkers were validated for LC-MS/MS analysis by direct
injection, while the other 20 biomarkers were present in wastewater at lower
concentrations, requiring extraction by solid phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis 
HLB cartridges. The limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 17 ng/L -
191 ng/L and 13 ng/L -110 ng/L for direct injection and SPE, respectively.
Recoveries for SPE ranged between 80% and 120%. Following validation, the method 
was applied to 28 wastewater samples from four municipal wastewater treatment
plants. Twenty-eight of the thirty-five analgesic biomarkers were detected in the
samples at concentrations of between 0.03 and 289 μg/L. Population normalised
mass loads ranged from 10 mg/day/1000 (meperidine) to 72,000 mg/day/1000
(paracetamol) among all investigated compounds. The described method is a
suitable analytical tool for wastewater-based epidemiology applications to
estimate analgesics consumption."

"Amodiaquine is a drug used for treatment of malaria and is often used in
combination with artesunate in areas where malaria parasites are still
susceptible to amodiaquine. Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry was
used to quantify amodiaquine and its active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine, in
plasma samples. A low sample volume of 100 µl, and high-throughput extraction
technique using a supported liquid extraction (SLE+) technique on an automated
liquid handler platform for faster sample processing are some of the advantages
of this method. Separation of amodiaquine from desethylamodiaquine was achieved
using a reversed phase Zorbax SB-CN 50 mm × 4.6 mm, I.D. 3.5 µm column with
acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium formate with 1% formic acid pH ~ 2.6 (15-85, v/v)
as mobile phase. The absolute recoveries of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine
were 66% to 76%, and their isotope label internal standard were in the range of
73% to 85%. Validation results of the developed method demonstrated intra-batch
and inter-batch precisions within the acceptance criteria range of ± 15.0%. There
were no matrix or carry-over effects observed. The lower limit of quantification 
was 1.08 ng/ml for amodiaquine and 1.41 ng/ml for desethylamodiaquine. The method
showed robust and accurate performance with high sensitivity. Thus, the validated
method was successfully implemented and applied in the evaluation of a clinical
trial where participants received artemether-lumefantrine plus amodiaquine twice 
daily for three days (amodiaquine dose of 10 mg base/kg/day)."

"The biomarkers used in wastewater-based epidemiology studies have a wide range of
physicochemical properties, making simultaneous analysis extremely challenging or
even impossible. So far, the majority of analytical procedures employed in this
field have focused on specific classes or a limited number of analytes. The
heart-cutting two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
technique (2D-LC-MS/MS) has enabled the incorporation of compounds with
significantly different polarities in a single analytical method. In this study, 
a 2D-LC-MS/MS method has been developed and optimized for the simultaneous
analysis of various biomarkers in wastewater, providing relevant information
about lifestyle habits (the usage of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine), health and 
well-being (pharmaceuticals), and a population size biomarker (5-HIAA) that is
useful for correct calculation of human population during wastewater-based
epidemiology studies. A single-laboratory validation procedure showed
satisfactory analytical performance, with the mean trueness for most compounds
falling in the range of 80÷110 % and the mean repeatability being less than 20 %.
The applicability of the method was evaluated by testing 28 wastewater samples
collected at different wastewater treatment plants in Latvia. The obtained
results revealed the occurrence of 44 out of 62 selected biomarkers, with the
lowest quantified concentration at 1.1 ng L-1 in the case of xylometazoline and
up to 148 μg L-1 in the case of metformin and 156 μg L-1 for caffeine."

"A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and
validated to quantify alectinib, crizotinib, erlotinib and gefitinib. This assay 
can be combined with our method for osimertinib, allowing quantification of the
most used ALK- and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung 
cancer with a single-assay setup. Chromatographic separation was performed on a
HyPurity® C18 analytical column using an elution gradient of ammonium acetate in 
water and in methanol, both acidified with formic acid 0.1%. Detection and
quantification were performed using a triple quad mass spectrometer with an
electrospray ionization interface. This method led to robust results, as the
selectivity, carryover, precision and accuracy met all pre-specified
requirements. The assay was validated over a linear range of 100-2,000 ng/ml for 
alectinib and erlotinib and 50-1,000 ng/ml for crizotinib and gefitinib.
Alectinib, crizotinib, erlotinib and gefitinib were all stable for at least 4 h
in whole blood (at room temperature and at 4°C) and for at least 1 month in EDTA 
plasma when stored at -80°C, while osimertinib proved to be unstable at room
temperature. Although high-performance liquid chromatography was used, the run
time was short and comparable with other methods using ultra-high performance
liquid chromatography."

"The jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) gene catalyzes the arginine
demethylation and lysine hydroxylation of histone and a growing list of its known
substrate molecules, including p53 and U2AF65, suggesting a possible role in mRNA
splicing and transcription in cancer progression. Mass spectrometry-based
technology offers the opportunity to detect SNP variants accurately and
effectively. In our study, we conducted a combined computational and filtration
workflow to predict the nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs)
present in JMJD6, followed by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) analysis and validation. The computational approaches SIFT,
PolyPhen-2, SNAP, I-Mutant 2.0, PhD-SNP, PANTHER, and SNPS&GO were integrated to 
screen out the predicted damaging/deleterious nsSNPs. Through the
three-dimensional structure of JMJD6, H187R (rs1159480887) was selected as a
candidate for validation. The validation experiments showed that the mutation of 
this nsSNP in JMJD6 obviously affected mRNA splicing or the transcription of
downstream genes through the reduced lysyl-hydroxylase activity of its
substrates, U2AF65 and p53, further indicating the accuracy of this prediction
method. This research provides an effective computational workflow for
researchers with an opportunity to select prominent deleterious nsSNPs and, thus,
remains promising for examining the dysfunction of proteins."

"Each drug has pharmacokinetics that must be defined for the substance to be used 
in humans and animals. Currently, one of the basic analytical tools for
pharmacokinetics studies is high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
mass spectrometry. For this analytical method to be fully reliable, it must be
properly validated. Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop and
validate a novel analytical method for 4-acetamidobenzoic acid, a component of
the antiviral and immunostimulatory drug Inosine Pranobex, and to apply the
method in the first pharmacokinetics study of 4-acetamidobenzoic acid in pigs
after oral administration. Inosine Pranobex was administered under farm
conditions to pigs via drinking water 2 h after morning feeding at doses of 20,
40, and 80 mg/kg. For sample preparation, we used liquid-liquid extraction with
only one step-protein precipitation with 1 mL of acetonitrile. As an internal
standard, we used deuterium labeled 4-acetamidobenzoic acid. The results indicate
that the described method is replicable, linear (r2 ≥ 0.99), precise (2.11% to
13.81%), accurate (89% to 98.57%), selective, and sensitive (limit of
quantitation = 10 ng/mL). As sample preparation requires only one step, the
method is simple, effective, cheap, and rapid. The results of the pilot
pharmacokinetics study indicate that the compound is quickly eliminated
(elimination half-life from 0.85 to 1.42 h) and rapidly absorbed (absorption
half-life from 0.36 to 2.57 h), and that its absorption increases exponentially
as the dose is increased."

"Improved methods are required for investigating the systemic metabolic effects of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient stratification for precision treatment. We aimed
to develop an effective method using lipid profiles for discriminating between
SARS-CoV-2 infection, healthy controls, and non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory
infections. Targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipid profiling was 
performed on discovery (20 SARS-CoV-2-positive; 37 healthy controls; 22 COVID-19 
symptoms but SARS-CoV-2negative) and validation (312 SARS-CoV-2-positive; 100
healthy controls) cohorts. Orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to establish
discriminant lipids, significance, and effect size, followed by logistic
regression to evaluate classification performance. OPLS-DA reported separation of
SARS-CoV-2 infection from healthy controls in the discovery cohort, with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 1.000. A refined panel of discriminant features
consisted of six lipids from different subclasses (PE, PC, LPC, HCER, CER, and
DCER). Logistic regression in the discovery cohort returned a training ROC AUC of
1.000 (sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 1.000) and a test ROC AUC of 1.000. The
validation cohort produced a training ROC AUC of 0.977 (sensitivity = 0.855,
specificity = 0.948) and a test ROC AUC of 0.978 (sensitivity = 0.948,
specificity = 0.922). The lipid panel was also able to differentiate
SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals from SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals with
COVID-19-like symptoms (specificity = 0.818). Lipid profiling and multivariate
modelling revealed a signature offering mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2,
with strong predictive power, and the potential to facilitate effective diagnosis
and clinical management."

"In France, four groups of lipophilic toxins are currently regulated: okadaic
acid/dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins, yessotoxins and azaspiracids. However, many
other families of toxins exist, which can be emerging toxins. Emerging toxins
include both toxins recently detected in a specific area of France but not
regulated yet (e.g., cyclic imines, ovatoxins) or toxins only detected outside of
France (e.g., brevetoxins). To anticipate the introduction to France of these
emerging toxins, a monitoring program called EMERGTOX was set up along the French
coasts in 2018. The single-laboratory validation of this approach was performed
according to the NF V03-110 guidelines by building an accuracy profile. Our
specific, reliable and sensitive approach allowed us to detect brevetoxins (BTX-2
and/or BTX-3) in addition to the lipophilic toxins already regulated in France.
Brevetoxins were detected for the first time in French Mediterranean mussels
(Diana Lagoon, Corsica) in autumn 2018, and regularly every year since during the
same seasons (autumn, winter). The maximum content found was 345 µg (BTX-2 +
BTX-3)/kg in mussel digestive glands in November 2020. None were detected in
oysters sampled at the same site. In addition, a retroactive analysis of
preserved mussels demonstrated the presence of BTX-3 in mussels from the same
site sampled in November 2015. The detection of BTX could be related to the
presence in situ at the same period of four Karenia species and two
raphidophytes, which all could be potential producers of these toxins. Further
investigations are necessary to understand the origin of these toxins."

"The Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs), including pesticides, have been a
trending topic and Brazil is the country with the highest usage of pesticides
worldwide. This study aimed to measure the presence of pesticide residues in the 
water from different sources in the city of Porto Alegre. We analyzed 55 samples 
from drinking water treatment plants, public water sites, and sewage treatment
plants from winter 2018 to summer 2020 by solid-phase extraction and
high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
Among 184 pesticides evaluated, 107 matched validation criteria (linearity,
trueness, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility) and 15 of them were detected 
in different water samples, including seven insecticides, five antifungals, and
three herbicides, with a wide range of toxicity levels and noticeable seasonal
differences. For the worst-case scenario evaluation, 20 out of 22 (90.9%) samples
exceeded the Risk Quotient of 1. The sum of pesticide concentrations exceeded
100 ng L-1 in 66.7% of samples in February 19 and in 75% of samples in February
20 and the total pesticide concentration has reached the worrisome mark of 1615
and 954.96 ng L-1 respectively. Therefore, our results make evident the need to
promote public policies to achieve better water quality monitoring. PRACTITIONER 
POINTS: Among 184 pesticides evaluated, 107 matched validation criteria
(linearity, trueness, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility). A total of 55
different water samples were analyzed, and 15 pesticides were detected and five
quantified. For the worst-case scenario evaluation, 20 out of 21 samples exceeded
the Risk Quotient of 1 on Feb/20. The pesticide concentrations sum exceeded
100 ng L-1 in 66.7% of samples on February 19 and in 75% of samples on February
20. It is mandatory to improve water monitoring to guide the development of
public policies concerning its quality."

"The present study was conducted to investigate the residue status of two
insecticides (acetamiprid and buprofezin) and their dissipation kinetics in three
matrices viz. paddy grain, straw, and soil. The extraction procedure for residues
of these two insecticides was executed using acetonitrile solvent. The analytical
method was validated, which showed good linearity with the limit of
quantification (LOQ) value of 0.01 and 0.02 mg kg-1 for acetamiprid and
buprofezin, respectively. The recovery range was 79.67-98.33 % concerning all the
matrices in both the insecticides. Acetamiprid (20% SP) and Buprofezin (25% SC)
were applied separately in the paddy field in two doses: single dose (recommended
dose) and double dose along with untreated control throughout the experiment.
Residue analysis of these two insecticides in paddy (grain and straw) and soil
was accomplished employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
ultraviolet (UV) detector and confirmed by ultra-performance liquid
chromatography (UPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The
dissipation data showed that acetamiprid exhibited higher dissipation in
comparison with buprofezin. However, their persistence was found slightly higher 
in soil. The dissipation dynamics in the rice and soil were discussed with
biological half-lives of both the insecticides. Consumer risk assessment study
was also made considering its fate to the consumers."

"devTOX quickPredict (devTOX qP ) is a metabolomics biomarker-based assay that
utilises human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to screen for potential early
stage embryonic developmental toxicity in vitro. Developmental toxicity potential
is assessed based on the assay endpoint of the alteration in the ratio of key
unrelated biomarkers, ornithine and cystine (o/c). This work aimed to compare the
developmental toxicity potential of tobacco-containing and tobacco-free
non-combustible nicotine products to cigarette smoke. Smoke and aerosol from test
articles were produced using a Vitrocell VC10 smoke/aerosol exposure system and
bubbled into phosphate buffered saline (bPBS). iPS cells were exposed to
concentrations of up to 10% bPBS. Assay sensitivity was assessed through a
spiking study with a known developmental toxicant, all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA), in combination with cigarette smoke extract. The bPBS extracts of
reference cigarettes (1R6F and 3R4F) and a heated tobacco product (HTP) were
predicted to have the potential to induce developmental toxicity, in this
screening assay. The bPBS concentration at which these extracts exceeded the
developmental toxicity threshold was 0.6% (1R6F), 1.3% (3R4F), and 4.3% (HTP)
added to the cell media. Effects from cigarette smoke and HTP aerosol were driven
largely by cytotoxicity, with the cell viability and o/c ratio dose-response
curves crossing the developmental toxicity thresholds at very similar
concentrations of added bPBS. The hybrid product and all the electronic cigarette
(e-cigarette) aerosols were not predicted to be potential early developmental
toxicants, under the conditions of this screening assay."

"A wide-range, specific, and precise liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometric (LC-MS/MS)technique for quantifying fluoxetine (FLX) in human
plasma was developed using the RapidTrace® automated solid-phase extraction (SPE)
method; the analyte and internal standard (IS) were extricated on Oasis MCX SPE
cartridges. Acetonitrile and 5 mM ammonium formate buffer (90:10 v/v) were used
as mobile phase to achieve chromatographic separation on the reverse phase (C18
column). The analyte and IS were ionized using +ve electrospray ionization
approach which was further traced by multiple-reaction monitoring on a tandem
mass spectrometer. To quantify the FLX and FLX-d5, the parent-to-daughter ion
transition of m/z of 310.0/44.1 and 315.0/44.0 was used, respectively. The method
demonstrated a linear active limit of 0.20-30 ng/ml with recoveries ranging from 
63.04% to 79.39% for quality control samples and 61.25% for IS samples. The
concentrations over the calibration range demonstrated acceptable precision and
accuracy. Due to the high inconsistency of the FLX concentration data, the
minimum threshold of the assay was kept at 0.20 ng/ml. The flow rate was
maintained at 500 μL/min, and the time for sample analysis for each injection was
3.5 min. The method was found to be specific, sensitive, and faster with minimum 
utilization of organic solvents and was utilized further for metabolic and
pharmacokinetic studies."

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic reprogramming plays an important role in
tumorigenesis. However, the metabolic types of different tumors are diverse and
lack of in-depth study. Here, through analysis of big databases and clinical
samples, we identified Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I(CPS1)-deficient
hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) subtype, explored tumorigenesis mechanism of this
HCC subtype, and aimed to investigate metabolic reprogramming as target for HCC
prevention.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Pan-cancer study involving differentially expressed
metabolic genes of 7,764 tumor samples in 16 cancer types provided by The Cancer 
Genome Atlas(TCGA) demonstrated that urea cycle(UC) was liver-specific and
HCC-downregulated. A large-scale gene expression data analysis including a total 
of 2,596 HCC cases in 7 HCCDB datasets combined with a total of 17,444
hepatectomy cohort data identified a specific CPS1-deficent HCC subtype with poor
clinical prognosis. In vitro and in vivo validation confirmed crucial role of
CPS1 in HCC. LC-MS assay and Seahorse analysis revealed that UC
dysregulation(UCD) led to the deceleration of the tricarboxylic acid(TCA) cycle, 
while excess ammonia caused by CPS1 deficiency activated fatty acid
β-oxidation(FAO) through p-AMPK. Mechanistically, FAO provided sufficient ATP for
cell proliferation and enhanced chemoresistance of HCC cells by activating FOXM1.
Subcutaneous xenograft tumor models and patient-derived organoids(PDOs) were
employed to identify that blocking FAO by Eto may provide therapeutic benefit to 
HCC patients with CPS1-deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results prove a direct link between UCD and
cancer stemness in HCC, define a CPS1-deficient HCC subtype through big-data
mining, and provide insights for novel therapeutic for this type of HCC through
targeting FAO."

"Aflatoxins (AFs) are toxic fungal secondary metabolites that are commonly
detected in food commodities. Currently, there is a lack of generic methods
capable of determining AFs both at postharvest stages in agricultural products
and preharvest stages, namely, the agricultural soil. Here, we present a simple
and reliable method for quantitative analysis of AFs in soil and food matrices at
environmentally relevant concentrations for the first time, using the same
extraction procedure and chromatography, either by HPLC-FLD or LC-MS. AFs were
extracted from matrices by ultrasonication using an acetonitrile/water mixture
(84:16, v + v) without extensive and time-consuming cleanup procedures. Food
extracts were defatted with n-hexane. Matrix effects in terms of signal
suppression/enhancement (SSE) for HPLC-FLD were within ±20% for all matrices
tested. For LC-MS, the SSE values were mostly within ±20% for soil matrices but
outside ±20% for all food matrices. The sensitivity of the method allowed
quantitative analysis even at trace levels with quantification limits (LOQs)
between 0.04 and 0.23 μg kg-1 for HPLC-FLD and 0.06-0.23 μg kg-1 for LC-MS. The
recoveries ranged from 64 to 92, 74 to 101, and 78 to 103% for fortification
levels of 0.5, 5, and 20 μg kg-1, respectively, with repeatability values of
2-18%. The validation results are in accordance with the quality criteria and
limits for mycotoxins set by the European Commission, thus confirming a
satisfactory performance of the analytical method. Although reliable analysis is 
possible with both instruments, the HPLC-FLD method may be more suitable for
routine analysis because it does not require consideration of the matrix."

"The past decades have seen a rise in the prescription of antipsychotic drugs in
the European population, despite the risk of extra-pyramidal, metabolic and
cardiac side effects. A multi-analyte liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry method was developed for the quantification of 38 antipsychotic
drugs in plasma. Samples were extracted by a straightforward liquid-liquid
extraction with methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether and the compounds of interest were
chromatographically separated within 6 min. Calibration curves covered the
recommended therapeutic range for all compounds, in addition to sub- and
supratherapeutic concentrations for most. The method was successfully validated
according to the European Medicines Agency guidelines on bioanalytical method
validation. Analysis of medico-legal samples confirmed the relatively common use 
of the second generation antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine, as well as the
continued presence of the first generation antipsychotic haloperidol."

"An original, innovative, high-throughput method based on attenuated total
reflectance - Fourier's transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy has been
developed for the proof-of-concept discrimination of fibre-type from drug-type
Cannabis sativa L. inflorescences. The cannabis sample is placed on the
instrument plate and analysed without any previous sample pretreatment step. In
this way, a complete analysis lasts just a few seconds, the time needed to record
an ATR-FTIR spectrum. The method was calibrated and cross-validated using data
provided by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis 
of the different cannabis samples and carried out the statistical assays for
quantitation. During cross-validation, complete agreement was obtained between
ATR-FTIR and LC-MS/MS identification of the cannabis chemotype. Moreover, the
method has proved to be capable of quantifying with excellent accuracy (75-103 % 
vs. LC-MS/MS) seven neutral and acidic cannabinoids (THC, THCA, CBD, CBDA, CBG,
CBGA, CBN) in inflorescences from different sources. The extreme feasibility and 
speed of execution make this ATR-FTIR method highly attractive as a
proof-of-concept for a possible application to quality controls during
pharmaceutical product manufacturing, as well as on-the-street cannabis controls 
and user counselling."

"Niclosamide, which is an anti-tapeworm drug, was developed in 1958. However,
recent studies have demonstrated the antiviral effects of niclosamide against the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. In this study, we developed and
validated a quantitative analysis method for the determination of niclosamide in 
rat and dog plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS), and used this method for pharmacokinetic studies. Biological samples 
were prepared using the protein precipitation method with acetonitrile. Ibuprofen
was used as an internal standard. The mobile phase used to quantify niclosamide
in rat or dog plasma consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate in distilled
water-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) or 5 mM ammonium acetate-methanol (30:70, v/v).
An XDB-phenyl column (5 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm) and a Kinetex® C18 column (5 µm,
2.1 × 500 mm) were used as reverse-phase liquid chromatography columns for rat
and dog plasma analyses, respectively. Niclosamide and ibuprofen were detected
under multiple reaction monitoring conditions using the electrospray ionization
interface running in the negative ionization mode. Niclosamide presented
linearity in the concentration ranges of 1-3000 ng/mL (r = 0.9967) and
1-1000 ng/mL (r = 0.9941) in rat and dog plasma, respectively. The intra- and
inter-day precision values were < 7.40% and < 6.35%, respectively, for rat
plasma, and < 3.95% and < 4.01%, respectively, for dog plasma. The intra- and
inter-day accuracy values were < 4.59% and < 6.63%, respectively, for rat plasma,
and < 12.1% and < 10.9%, respectively, for dog plasma. In addition, the
recoveries of niclosamide ranged between 87.8 and 99.6% and 102-104% for rat and 
dog plasma, respectively. Niclosamide was stable during storage under various
conditions (three freeze-thaw cycles, 6 h at room temperature, long-term, and
processed samples). A reliable LC-MS/MS method for niclosamide detection was
successfully used to perform pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs.
Niclosamide presented dose-independent pharmacokinetics in the dose range of
0.3-3 mg/kg after intravenous administration, and drug exposure in rats and dogs 
after oral administration was very low. Additionally, niclosamide presented high 
plasma protein binding (>99.8%) and low metabolic stability. These results can be
helpful for further developing and understanding the pharmacokinetic
characteristics of niclosamide to expand its clinical use."

"BACKGROUND: Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy 
(eNAD/EDM) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder associated with a vitamin E
deficiency within the first year of life. Vitamin E consists of 8 isoforms
metabolized by the CYP4F2 enzyme. No antemortem diagnostic test currently exists 
for eNAD/EDM.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Based on the association of α-tocopherol deficiency with
the development of eNAD/EDM, we hypothesized that the rate of α-tocopherol, but
not γ-tocopherol or tocotrienol metabolism, would be increased in
eNAD/EDM-affected horses.
ANIMALS: Vitamin E metabolism: Proof of concept (POC) study; eNAD/EDM-affected
(n = 5) and control (n = 6) horses. Validation study: eNAD/EDM-affected Quarter
Horses (QHs; n = 6), cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy affected (n = 6)
horses and control (n = 29) horses. CYP4F2 expression and copy number:
eNAD/EDM-affected (n = 12) and age- and sex-matched control (n = 11-12) horses.
METHODS: The rates of α-tocopherol/tocotrienol and γ-tocopherol/tocotrienol
metabolism were assessed in equine serum (POC and validation) and urine (POC
only) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and droplet digital (dd)-PCR
were used to assay expression and genomic copy number of a CYP4F2 equine
ortholog.
RESULTS: Metabolic rate of α-tocopherol was increased in eNAD/EDM horses
(POC,P < .0001; validation, P = .03), with no difference in the metabolic rate of
γ-tocopherol. Horses with eNAD/EDM had increased expression of the CYP4F2 equine 
orthologue (P = .02) but no differences in copy number.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Increased α-tocopherol metabolism in
eNAD/EDM-affected QHs provides novel insight into alterations in vitamin E
processing in eNAD/EDM and highlights the need for high-dose supplementation to
prevent the clinical phenotype in genetically susceptible horses."

"Herbal medicines have historically been practiced in combinatorial way, which
achieves therapeutic efficacy by integrative effects of multi-components. Thus,
the accurate and precise measurement of multi bioactive components in matrices is
inalienable to understanding the metabolism and disposition of herbal medicines. 
In this study, aiming to provide a strategy that improves analyte coverage,
evaluation of six protocols employing sample pretreatment methods- protein
precipitation (PPT), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), sugaring-out-assisted
liquid-liquid extraction (SULLE), and salting-out-assisted liquid-liquid
extraction (SALLE)- was performed by LC-MS/MS using rat plasma and a mixture of
alkaloid (evodiamine, rutaecarpine, dehydroevodiamine), terpenoid (limonin,
rutaevin, obacunone), and flavonoid (liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin)
standards isolated from Tetradium ruticarpum and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. These
protocols were as follows: (1) PPT with methanol, (2) PPT with acetonitrile, (3) 
LLE with methyl tertiary-butyl ether-dichloromethane, (4) LLE with ethyl
acetate-n-butanol, (5) SALLE with ammonium acetate, (6) SULLE with glucose. The
results suggested that SALLE produced broader analyte coverage with satisfactory 
reproducibility, acceptable recovery, and low matrix interference. Then, sample
preparation procedure of SALLE, chromatographic conditions, and mass
spectrometric parameters were optimized, followed by method validation, showing
that good sensitivity (LLOQ ≤ 1 ng mL-1), linearity (r ≥ 0.9933), precision
(RSD ≤ 14.45%), accuracy (89.54~110.87%), and stability could be achieved. Next, 
the developed method was applied successfully to determine the pharmacokinetic
behavior of the nine compounds in rat plasma after intragastric administration
with an extract from Tetradium ruticarpum and Glycyrrhiza uralensis
(Wuzhuyu-Gancao pair). Based on an extensive review and experiments, a sample
preparation procedure that matches with LC-MS/MS technique and can get wider
analyte coverage was outlined. The developed SALLE method is rapid, reliable, and
suitable for bioanalysis of analytes with diverse polarity, which was expected to
be a promising strategy for the pharmacokinetic studies of herbal medicines.

"Midostaurin (MDS) is used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and advanced systemic mastocytosis. MDS softgel capsule
samples were subjected to stress testing per International Conference on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use guidelines for impurity profiling study. MDS underwent extensive
degradation under stress testing (acid, alkaline, oxidative, photolytic,
thermolytic, and hydrolysis conditions) and formed four degradation products
(DPs). MDS and its DPs were separated well from one another with good resolution 
using reserved-phase HPLC using an Inertsil ODS-3V column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm)
and a mobile phase of ammonium formate (40 mM) and acetonitrile. The
stability-indicating characteristic of the newly developed method was proven for 
the estimation of MDS assay, and its organic impurities were free from
interference. The validated method exhibited excellent linearity, accuracy,
precision, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit within 25 min run
time. Stress testing, robustness, and solution stability were performed to ensure
the continuous performance of the developed method. The peak fractions of DPs
formed under stress testing were isolated and characterized using LC-MS, 1 H and 
13 C NMR, IR, and UV-Vis. The structure of the major DPs was predicted as DP1
based on the spectral data. The proposed method is effectively used for MDS in
bulk drug and finished formulations in the pharmaceutical industry."

"Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain is a common hallmark of most
age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies from our group
identified the presence of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in leaves 
derived from the Chilean berry Ugni molinae (murtilla), in addition to show a
potent anti-aggregation activity in models of Alzheimer´s disease. However,
possible beneficial effects of berry extracts of murtilla was not investigated.
Here we evaluated the efficacy of fruit extracts from different genotypes of
Chilean-native U. molinae on reducing protein aggregation using cellular models
of Huntington´s disease and assess the correlation with their chemical
composition. Berry extraction was performed by exhaustive maceration with
increasing-polarity solvents. An unbiased automatic microscopy platform was used 
for cytotoxicity and protein aggregation studies in HEK293 cells using
polyglutamine-EGFP fusion proteins, followed by secondary validation using
biochemical assays. Phenolic-rich extracts from murtilla berries of the 19-1
genotype (ETE 19-1) significantly reduced polyglutamine peptide aggregation
levels, correlating with the modulation in the expression levels of
autophagy-related proteins. Using LC-MS and molecular network analysis we
correlated the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ellagitannins with the
protective effects of ETE 19-1 effects on protein aggregation. Overall, our
results indicate the presence of bioactive components in ethanolic extracts from 
U. molinae berries that reduce the load of protein aggregates in living cells."

"Metabolic phenotyping is an important tool in translational biomedical research. 
The advanced analytical technologies commonly used for phenotyping, including
mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
generate complex data requiring tailored statistical analysis methods. Detailed
protocols have been published for data acquisition by liquid NMR, solid-state
NMR, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (LC-)MS and gas chromatography
(GC-)MS on biofluids or tissues and their preprocessing. Here we propose an
efficient protocol (guidelines and software) for statistical analysis of
metabolic data generated by these methods. Code for all steps is provided, and no
prior coding skill is necessary. We offer efficient solutions for the different
steps required within the complete phenotyping data analytics workflow: scaling, 
normalization, outlier detection, multivariate analysis to explore and model
study-related effects, selection of candidate biomarkers, validation, multiple
testing correction and performance evaluation of statistical models. We also
provide a statistical power calculation algorithm and safeguards to ensure robust
and meaningful experimental designs that deliver reliable results. We exemplify
the protocol with a two-group classification study and data from an
epidemiological cohort; however, the protocol can be easily modified to cover a
wider range of experimental designs or incorporate different modeling approaches.
This protocol describes a minimal set of analyses needed to rigorously
investigate typical datasets encountered in metabolic phenotyping."

"Alpha-chloralose (AC) is used as a rodenticide as well as an anaesthetic agent in
laboratory animals. It was previously also used as an avicide. Detection of AC in
blood samples or post-mortem in body tissues is key for diagnosis of clinical
cases and a requirement for surveillance of secondary toxicosis, including
potential cases in wild animals. Reports on poisoning of humans and
non-laboratory animals confirmed by detection of AC or its metabolites are
available, although rarely on domestic animals. Furthermore, reports on clinical 
cases in domestic animals rarely report quantifications of AC in blood or body
tissues. The present study describes the validation of a quantitative UHPLC-MS/MS
method that can be used in cases of suspected AC poisoning in cats. The
validation study showed the method to be fit for purpose. In serum the limit of
quantification was 100 ng/mL and the limit of detection 30 ng/mL. The new
analytical method was applied on blood samples collected from 20 individual cats 
with a preliminary clinical diagnosis of acute AC poisoning. Alpha-chloralose was
confirmed in all 20 feline blood samples, and the concentration range of AC was
538 -17 500 ng/mL. The quantitative method developed in this study was found to
be a fast and selective method for confirmation of AC poisoning using blood
samples from cats."

"JQ1, is a cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and
extra-terminal protein (BET) function with reportedly good CNS penetration,
however, unbound and pharmacologically active CNS JQ1 exposures have not been
characterized. Additionally, no quantitative bioanalytical methods for JQ1 have
been described in the literature to support the CNS penetration studies. In the
present article, we discuss the development and validation of a sensitive and
reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) quantitative
methods to determine JQ1 in mouse plasma and brain microdialysate. JQ1 and the
internal standard, dabrafenib (ISTD), were extracted from plasma and
microdialysate samples using a simple solid phase extraction protocol performed
on an Oasis HLB μElution plate. Chromatographic separation of JQ1 and ISTD was
achieved on a reversed phase C12 analytical column with gradient elution profile 
of mobile phases (MP A: water containing 0.1 % formic acid and MP B: acetonitrile
containing 0.1 % formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The mass
spectrometric detection was performed in the positive MRM ion mode by monitoring 
the transitions 457.40 > 341.30 (JQ1) and 520.40 > 307.20 (ISTD). The calibration
curves demonstrated good linearities over the concentration range of 5-1000 ng/mL
for the mouse plasma method (r2 ≥ 0.99) and 0.5-500 ng/mL for the microdialysate 
method (r2 ≥ 0.99). The experimental limit of quantification obtained was 5 and
0.5 ng/mL for the mouse plasma and microdialysate method, respectively, with the 
coefficient of variation less than 10 % for the analyte peak area. All the other 
validation parameters, including intra-and inter-day accuracy and precision,
matrix effect, selectivity, carryover effect, and stability, were within the
USFDA bioanalytical guidelines acceptance limits. The LC-MS/MS method was
successfully applied to a mouse pharmacokinetic and cerebral microdialysis study 
to characterize the unbound JQ1 exposure in brain extracellular fluid and plasma."

"5-Amino-1-methyl quinolinium (5-AMQ) is a potent Nicotinamide N-methyl
transferase (NNMT) inhibitor. NNMT is an enzyme that catalyzes the N-methylation 
of the endogenous substrate nicotinamide, as well as exogenous xenobiotics. NNMT 
is fundamental to cellular metabolism; NNMT is overexpressed in select tissues
(e.g., adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, etc.) in pathophysiological conditions,
making it a clinically relevant target for drug development in several chronic
diseases including obesity and diabetes. The objective of this study was to
develop and validate a simple, sensitive, and reproducible liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification 
of 5-AMQ in rat plasma and urine samples. 5-AMQ was extracted from plasma and
urine by protein precipitation. Chromatographic separation was achieved using an 
ACE® Excel™ C18 column (2 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm) with a binary gradient solvent system 
comprising of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) containing 0.1 % formic acid as the 
mobile phase. Analysis was performed using an API 4000 QTRAP hybrid triple
quadruple mass spectrometer and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive
mode at m/z transitions of 159.100 → 90.00 and 162.200 → 117.200 for 5-AMQ and
the internal standard, respectively. The standard curves of 5-AMQ in rat urine
and plasma samples were linear in the concentration range of 10-2500 ng/mL. The
intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies for 5-AMQ at four concentration
levels in rat plasma and urine samples were found to be within the 15 % FDA
acceptance range. Similarly, the accuracy and precision of 5-AMQ quantification
in samples diluted up to 20-fold using blank plasma were within the 15 %
acceptable range. Furthermore, the extraction recoveries and matrix effects at
three concentration levels of rat plasma samples ranged from 99.5 %-110.6 % and
-6.1 %-14.1 %, respectively. 5-AMQ was stable in rat plasma samples subjected to 
standard storage, preparation, and handling conditions, with less than 15 %
variation noted at two concentration levels. The validated, sensitive, and
reproducible LC-MS/MS method for 5-AMQ in rat plasma and urine samples was
effectively applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats with IV and oral
administration of 5-AMQ. 5-AMQ displayed substantial plasma exposures via IV and 
oral route, with a mean maximum plasma concentration of 2252 ng/mL after oral
administration, mean area under the curve (AUC0-∞) of 3708 h.ng/mL and 14431
h.ng/mL for the IV and oral groups, respectively, mean terminal elimination
half-life of 3.80 ± 1.10 h and 6.90 ± 1.20 h respectively after intravenous and
oral dose, and a good oral bioavailability (F % = 38.4)."

"Agomelatine is a novel melatonergic antidepressant, with a non-monoaminergic
mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to evaluate its plasma
concentrations after a single oral dose of 300 mg/dog in fasted and fed status.
The research was carried out in 6 adult healthy Labrador dogs according to a
randomized open, single-dose, two-treatment, two-phase, paired 2 × 2 cross-over
study. At the end of the study all the animals had received the drug in fasted
and fed conditions. The drug concentrations were detected in plasma by a
validated LC-MS/MS analytical method. The plasma concentrations of agomelatine
were found to be extremely variable in both groups as well as the pharmacokinetic
profiles. Due to these variable findings the only reliable pharmacokinetic
parameters were assessed as Cmax (31.8 vs 15.7 ng/mL), Tmax (0.75 vs 4 h) and AUC
(155 vs 52 ng h/mL) in fasted and fed status, respectively. Unfortunately, as a
pioneer study, the small animal sample size used along with the unanticipated
variability did not allow to neither statistically estimate if food can affect
the pharmacokinetics of agomelatine nor recommend agomelatine for off-label
therapies in canine species. Further studies are warranted to clarify this issue."

"BACKGROUND: Alternaria toxins are ubiquitous contaminants in highly consumed food
products. Therefore, they are candidates to be regulated by EU legislation. In
this context the availability of reliable analytical methods is a keystone both
for protecting the health of the citizens and the smooth functioning of the
European market.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes an advanced LC-MS/MS method based on isotope
dilution quantification suitable for the determination of altenuene, alternariol,
alternariol monomethyl ether, tenuazonic acid and tentoxin in tomato puree, wheat
and sunflower seeds.
METHOD: The method has been validated in a collaborative trial that included the 
analysis of both, spiked and naturally contaminated food commodities.
Twenty-three participants contributed with analytical data.
RESULTS: The average recoveries and relative standard deviations for
repeatability and reproducibility obtained across the tested matrices were: 97%, 
8.0% and 23%, for altenuene, respectively; 95%, 9.2% and 17% for alternariol,
respectively; 98%, 6.4% and 13% for alternariol monomethyl ether, respectively;
97%, 4.2% and 9.3% for tenuazonic acid, respectively; and 102%, 5.6% and 15% for 
tentoxin, respectively. The method enabled the determination of all tested
Alternaria toxins close to or below 1 µg/kg.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the method showed a satisfactory trueness and precision,
complying with the requirements for the monitoring of mycotoxins in food in the
EU. It is currently under evaluation by the European Committee for
Standardization for the adoption as a standard method."

"The corm of Hypoxis hemerocallidea, commonly known as the African potato, is used
in traditional medicine to treat several medical conditions such as urinary
infections, benign prostate hyperplasia, inflammatory conditions and testicular
tumours. The metabolites contributing to the medicinal properties of H.
hemerocallidea have been identified in several studies and, more recently, the
active terpenoids of the plant were profiled. However, the biosynthetic pathways 
and the enzymes involved in the production of the terpene metabolites in H.
hemerocallidea have not been characterised at a transcriptomic or proteomic
level. In this study, total RNA extracted from the corm, leaf and flower tissues 
of H. hemerocallidea was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total
of 143,549 transcripts were assembled de novo using Trinity and 107,131
transcripts were functionally annotated using the nr, GO, COG, KEGG and
SWISS-PROT databases. Additionally, the proteome of the three tissues were
sequenced using LC-MS/MS, revealing aspects of secondary metabolism and serving
as data validation for the transcriptome. Functional annotation led to the
identification of numerous terpene synthases such as nerolidol synthase,
germacrene D synthase, and cycloartenol synthase amongst others. Annotations also
revealed a transcript encoding the terpene synthase phytoalexin momilactone A
synthase. Differential expression analysis using edgeR identified 946 transcripts
differentially expressed between the three tissues and revealed that the leaf
upregulates linalool synthase compared to the corm and the flower tissues. The
transcriptome as well as the proteome of Hypoxis hemerocallidea presented here
provide a foundation for future research."

"The aim of the work was the development and validation of an LC-MS/MS
γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) quantification method in urine and human serum by the use
of the analyte adduct ion formation strategy. A combined detection with a
conventional precursor ion in the negative electrospray mode and additionally GHB
adduct ions with both sodium acetate and lithium acetate was in focus. Therefore 
GHB quantification based on separated MS/MS signals. Two tandem mass
spectrometers representing different MS/MS generations (Sciex API 4000 QTrap and 
Sciex API 5500 QTrap) were used for method validation and comparison. Shimadzu
HPLC Systems equipped with a Luna 5 µm C18 (2) 100 A, 150 mm × 2 mm analytical
column were applied successfully for sample analyses. Infusion experiments were
performed for adduct identification and analyte detection optimisation. Sample
preparation could be limited to a simple and fast protein precipitation/sample
dilution. An effective signal separated GHB quantification with three independent
precursor ions representing separated areas of the mass spectrum was developed,
validated according to forensic guidelines and applied in the routine. The
developed and applied strategy resulted in a higher safety factor for the analyte
quantification performed in the forensic toxicology. A relevant analytical
improvement could be achieved with this alternative adduct based GHB analysis
since a good correlation of analyte concentrations calculated on the basis of
separated signals was stated as useful analytical information."

"Studying the metabolome of specific gestational compartments is of growing
interest in the context of fetus developmental disorders. However, the
metabolomes of the placenta and amniotic fluid (AF) are poorly characterized.
Therefore, we present the validation of a fingerprinting methodology. Using
pregnant rats, we performed exhaustive and robust extractions of metabolites in
the AF and lipids and more polar metabolites in the placenta. For the AF, we
compared the extraction capabilities of methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (ACN), and 
a mixture of both. For the placenta, we compared (i) the extraction capabilities 
of dichloromethane, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), and butanol, along with (ii) the
impact of lyophilization of the placental tissue. Analyses were performed on a
C18 and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography combined with
high-resolution mass spectrometry. The efficiency and the robustness of the
extractions were compared based on the number of the features or metabolites (for
untargeted or targeted approach, respectively), their mean total intensity, and
their coefficient of variation (% CV). The extraction capabilities of MeOH and
ACN on the AF metabolome were equivalent. Lyophilization also had no significant 
impact and usefulness on the placental tissue metabolome profiling. Considering
the placental lipidome, MTBE extraction was more informative because it allowed
extraction of a slightly higher number of lipids, in higher concentration. This
proof-of-concept study assessing the metabolomics and lipidomics of the AF and
the placenta revealed changes in both metabolisms, at two different stages of rat
gestation, and allowed a detailed prenatal metabolic fingerprinting."

"Neuroactive steroids are potent neuromodulators that play a critical role in both
maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. These stress-responsive compounds are
reportedly low in women with perinatal depression and may be associated with poor
pregnancy outcomes in animal models. Chronic stress is a risk factor for adverse 
birth outcomes. Simultaneous quantification of neuroactive steroids, in
combination with stress hormones cortisol/cortisone, provides an opportunity to
investigate the synergistic relationship of these analytes within the convenience
of one assay. A simple, reliable, and sensitive method for quantifying these
endogenous compounds is necessary for further research with the potential to
advance clinical diagnostic tools during pregnancy. Analytes were extracted from 
serum with a simple protein precipitation using methanol and then separated and
quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS/MS). After online extraction, analytes were separated using an Agilent
Poroschell 120, 50 × 4.6 mm, 2.7 μm particle size, EC-C18 analytical column. The 
reliable quantification range was from 0.78 to 1000 ng/mL. QC sample inter- and
intraday trueness was between 90 and 110% while inter- and intraday imprecision
was less than 10%. Extracted samples were stable up to 7 days at 4 °C and
extraction recovery was above 95%. Serum samples from 54 women in pregnancy were 
analyzed using this method. Here, we provide a validated, fast, and specific
assay with sufficient sensitivity that allows for simultaneous quantification of 
blood serum concentrations of allopregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one),
pregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), epipregnanolone
(3β-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), pregnenolone, progesterone, cortisol, and
cortisone in pregnancy for clinical study samples and clinical diagnostics."

"A bioanalytical method by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous quantification of 17 drugs and 2
major active metabolites in breast milk was developed and validated. Breast milk 
samples (100 μL) were submitted to a simple protein precipitation for the
extraction of the analytes after the addition of deuterated internal standards
(10 μL). A Kinetex C8 column was used for the separation of analytes with mobile 
phases composed of acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid and water with 0.1 %
formic acid in gradient elution mode. Analytes were detected using an AB/SCIEX
4000 QTRAP instrument with positive electrospray ionization and operating in
scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode. Validation covered a large range of 
concentrations (0.5-500 ng/mL) for most of the analytes except bisoprolol,
lacosamide, vilazodone (1-500 ng/mL), acid mycophenolic, letrozole, clomiphene
(2-500 ng/mL) and hydroxy-melatonin (10-500 ng/mL). Within-run and between-run
accuracy and precision for 4 levels of quality controls (QC) spiked at the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ), at 3 times the LLOQ, 50 % of the upper limit of
quantification (ULOQ) and 80 % of the ULOQ were in agreement with the criteria
from international guidelines. Matrix effect and extraction recovery ranged from 
40.7 to 106.5 % and 87.3 to 110.8 %, respectively with relative standard
deviations less than 15 %. Furthermore, all analytes were stable in breast milk
at room temperature for 24 h, at -20 °C for two weeks, at -80 °C for 1 month, and
after 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Finally, the method was successfully applied to
nursing women samples collected from an ongoing feasibility study on drug
quantification in breast milk."

"To absolutely and relatively quantitate the alteration of a posttranslationally
modified (PTM) proteome in response to a specific internal or external signal, a 
15N-stable isotope labeling in Arabidopsis (SILIA) protocol has been integrated
into the 4C quantitative PTM proteomics, named as SILIA-based 4C quantitative PTM
proteomics (S4Quap). The isotope metabolic labeling produces both forward (F) and
reciprocal (R) mixings of either 14N/15N-coded tissues or the 14N/15N-coded total
cellular proteins. Plant protein is isolated using a urea-based extraction buffer
(UEB). The presence of 8 M urea, 2% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), and 5 mM
ascorbic acid allows to instantly denature protein, remove the phenolic
compounds, and curb the oxidation by free radicals once plant cells are broken.
The total cellular proteins are routinely processed into peptides by trypsin. The
PTM peptide yield of affinity enrichment and preparation is 0.1-0.2% in general. 
Ion exchange chromatographic fractionation prepares the PTM peptides for LC-MS/MS
analysis. The collected mass spectrograms are subjected to a target-decoy
sequence analysis using various search engines. The computational programs are
subsequently applied to analyze the ratios of the extracted ion chromatogram
(XIC) of the 14N/15N isotope-coded PTM peptide ions and to perform the
statistical evaluation of the quantitation results. The Student t-test values of 
ratios of quantifiable 14N/15N-coded PTM peptides are normally corrected using a 
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple hypothesis test to select the significantly
regulated PTM peptide groups (BH-FDR < 5%). Consequently, the highly selected
prospect candidate(s) of PTM proteins are confirmed and validated using
biochemical, molecular, cellular, and transgenic plant analysis."

"Background: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is characterized by frequent
metastases to cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), and the presence of lymph node
metastasis at diagnosis has a significant impact on the surgical approach.
Therefore, we established a radiomic signature to predict the CLN status of PTC
patients using preoperative thyroid ultrasound, and investigated the association 
between the radiomic features and underlying molecular characteristics of PTC
tumors.
Methods: In total, 270 patients were enrolled in this prospective study, and
radiomic features were extracted according to multiple guidelines. A radiomic
signature was built with selected features in the training cohort and validated
in the validation cohort. The total protein extracted from tumor samples was
analyzed with LC/MS and iTRAQ technology. Gene modules acquired by clustering
were chosen for their diagnostic significance. A radiogenomic map linking
radiomic features to gene modules was constructed with the Spearman correlation
matrix. Genes in modules related to metastasis were extracted for Gene Ontology
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment
analyses, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built to identify
the hub genes in the modules. Finally, the screened hub genes were validated by
immunohistochemistry analysis.
Results: The radiomic signature showed good performance for predicting CLN status
in training and validation cohorts, with area under curve of 0.873 and 0.831
respectively. A radiogenomic map was created with nine significant correlations
between radiomic features and gene modules, and two of them had higher
correlation coefficient. Among these, MEmeganta representing the upregulation of 
telomere maintenance via telomerase and cell-cell adhesion was correlated with
'Rectlike' and 'deviation ratio of tumor tissue and normal thyroid gland' which
reflect the margin and the internal echogenicity of the tumor, respectively.
MEblue capturing cell-cell adhesion and glycolysis was associated with feature
'minimum calcification area' which measures the punctate calcification. The hub
genes of the two modules were identified by protein-protein interaction network. 
Immunohistochemistry validated that LAMC1 and THBS1 were differently expressed in
metastatic and non-metastatic tissues (p=0.003; p=0.002). And LAMC1 was
associated with feature 'Rectlike' and 'deviation ratio of tumor and normal
thyroid gland' (p<0.001; p<0.001); THBS1 was correlated with 'minimum
calcification area' (p<0.001).
Conclusions: The radiomic signature proposed here has the potential to
noninvasively predict the CLN status in PTC patients. Merging imaging phenotypes 
with genomic data could allow noninvasive identification of the molecular
properties of PTC tumors, which might support clinical decision making and
personalized management."

"Objective: Metformin (MET), an oral biguanide agent, can improve insulin
resistance and decrease hepatic glucose production, leading to a reduction in
blood-sugar levels. The objective of the present study was to develop and
validate simple and rapid LC-MS/MS method for analysis of MET in dried blood spot
(DBS) sample for patient monitoring studies purposes (drug adherence).
Methods: The chromatographic separation was achieved with Waters HSS-T3 column
using gradient elution of mobile phases of two solvents: 1) solvent A, consisted 
of 10mM ammonium formate, 0.2% formic acid 1%; and 2) acetonitrile solvent B,
contained 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The
total run time was 3.0 min. The effectiveness of chromatographic conditions was
optimized, and afatinib was used as the internal standard. The assay method was
validated using USP 26 and the ICH guidelines.
Results: The method showed good linearity in the range 8-48 ng/mL for MET with
correlation coefficient (r) >0.9907. The intra- and inter‑day precision values
for MET met the acceptance criteria as per regulatory guidelines. MET was stable 
during the stability studies at ambient temperature 25 °C, at refrigerator 4 °C, 
at 10 °C autosampler, freeze/thaw cycles and 30 days storage in a freezer at -30 
± 0.5 °C.
Conclusion: This method has successfully fulfilled all validation requirements
referring to EMA and FDA guidelines, and successfully can be applied for MET
adherence study. All the six studied patients were approved to metformin
adherence."

"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a recognized method to improve the quality
of use of antiepileptic drugs, such as perampanel (PRP). It is the first compound
in the class of selective non-competitive antagonists of AMPA receptors approved 
in 2012 in Europe and United States for adjunctive therapy of partial seizures.
Although several studies have recently underlined that a general reference range 
for PRP plasmatic concentration might be difficult to propose, TDM of this drug
is important in specific clinical situations, as hepatic or renal impairment or
co-administration with enzyme-inducing antiepileptics. Several methods have been 
described in literature for the determination of PRP in different biological
matrices, which include the use of liquid chromatography methods coupled with
ultraviolet, fluorescence, mass or tandem-mass spectrometry detection. Here we
describe the development and validation of a novel method for the measurement of 
PRP in plasma samples, based on a HPLC-UV/FL double detection approach and using 
ketoprofen as internal standard. PRP concentration in a small subset of plasma
samples of treated patients was evaluated using both our approach and a
commercially available CE-IVD LC-MS/MS method. The results obtained were
compared, and confirmed the possibility to use our method as an alternative to
LC-MS/MS in clinical routine."

"BACKGROUND: Oral fluid is a widely studied matrix able to isolate the primary
Cannabis constituent THC, facilitating its detection via mass spectrometry, and
in most cases link these findings to recent drug use. As an alternative to liquid
oral fluid, dried oral fluid spots (DOFS) is a simple and a low-cost sampling
technique. It has shown improved stability compared to liquid samples, allowing
for the possibility to preserve the specimens under various temperature and
humidity conditions. The sampling strategy is straightforward and involves the
application of a small quantity of oral fluid aliquot to a paper substrate that
is set to air dry allowing for on-site collection at a large-scale demand. The
goal of this study is to study THC and CBD extraction from DOFS, applying a
previous established protocol for a LC-MS/MS qualitative method validation.
Although other drugs of abuse have been included in DOFS methods, this is the
first method validation including cannabinoids. An alternative oral fluid
extraction method (WAX-S tips) is demonstrated to improve the recovery of the
analytes.
METHODS: A pool of blank oral fluid was used to prepare THC and CBD spiked DOFS
samples for method validation and application. Spiked oral fluid was used to
demonstrate WAX-S tips THC and CBD extraction. All samples were analyzed on a
LC-MS/MS instrument.
RESULTS: The qualitative method validation for THC and CBD confirmation in DOFS
included method selectivity, matrix effects (< 20%), recovery (average of 25%),
process efficiency (average of 21%), LOD (2 ng/mL for THC and 4 ng/mL for CBD),
absence of carryover, and DOFS stability (70% in 35 days) as figures of merit.
The method application in blindly prepared samples demonstrated the method
capability to identify THC and CBD. WAX-S tips extraction showed an average of
91% recovery of THC and CBD from liquid oral fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: THC and CBD extraction from DOFS showed low recoveries. However, the
LC-MS/MS qualitative confirmation of THC and CBD in DOFS could improve
cannabinoids screening in oral fluid, as it shows adequate LOD and stability over
time. This method has potential for assisting the screening of drivers under
possible drug influence by facilitating sample transportation and temporary
storage in dried spot form. Additional research is suggested for WAX-S tips
extraction and quantitative method validation."

"New nicotine delivery products are gaining market share. For evaluation of their 
characteristics, toxicokinetic investigations are in current research focus. For 
reliable determination of blood plasma levels of nicotine and its main
metabolites cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, a quantitation method based on
LC-ESI-MS/MS was developed and validated. Addition of isotope labeled internal
standards prior to rapid sample preparation using protein precipitation with
methanol was chosen for sample preparation. Different stationary phases were
tested and phenyl-hexyl separation was found to be superior to HILIC, C18, and C8
stationary phases. Ion suppression effects caused by hydrophilic early eluting
matrix were eliminated by the adjustment of an adequate retention utilizing a
phenyl-hexyl separation stationary phase. Exchange of acetonitrile as organic
mobile phase by methanol and elevation of pH value of aqueous mobile phase
containing 5 mM NH4Ac to 4.50 improved the chromatographic resolution. The limits
of quantitation for nicotine, cotinine, and hydroxycotinine were 0.15, 0.30, and 
0.40 ng/mL, respectively. Linearity was proven by matrix matched calibration for 
the whole working range from 0.50 ng/mL to 35.0 ng/mL for nicotine and from 6.00 
to 420 ng/mL for cotinine and hydroxycotinine (Mandel's fitting test with
R2 > 0.995). Quality control samples at four different levels (0.50, 1.50, 17.5, 
28.0 ng/mL for nicotine and 6.00, 18.0, 210, 336 ng/mL for cotinine and
hydroxycotinine) in plasma were analyzed six times on three days. Mean accuracies
ranged from 87.7% to 105.8% for nicotine, from 90.3% to 102.9% for cotinine, and 
from 99.9% to 109.9% for hydroxycotinine. Intra- and inter-day precisions (RSD %)
were below 15% for all analytes (<20% for LLOQ). As proof of concept, the method 
was successfully applied to a real plasma sample from a cigarette smoking
volunteer."

"New psychoactive substances are being launched in the drug market at a rapidly
growing pace. More than 950 new psychoactive substances have been reported to the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The development of new psychoactive
substance abuse has drawn risks on public health and safety. Phenethylamines,
along with other stimulants, accounted for the majority of the new psychoactive
substances being reported in the past decade. This study presents a liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous
screening of 74 conventional and artificial phenethylamines in urine samples. The
chromatographic analysis was performed by a direct dilute-and-shoot procedure
using a Phenomenex Kinetex® Phenyl-Hexyl column (10 cm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 µm) and
two mobile phases (A: 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution with 5 mM ammonium
acetate, B: 0.1% formic acid methanolic solution). The mass fragments were
collected under the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The linearity range
located in 1.0-50.0 ng/mL for quantitative analysis. The limit of detection and
lower limit of quantification for 74 phenethylamines were 0.5 ng/mL and
1.0 ng/mL, respectively. The method was validated and further applied to analyze 
authentic urine samples. Twenty samples were tested positive of seven
phenethylamines from 67 samples, whereas the contents detected were 9.8 ng/mL to 
147.1 μg/mL with dilution factors of 40 to 20,000 folds."

"To support a phase III randomized trial of the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase
inhibitor cabozantinib in neuroendocrine tumors, we developed a high-performance 
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to quantitate cabozantinib in
50 μL of human plasma. After acetonitrile protein precipitation, chromatographic 
separation was achieved with a Phenomenex synergy polar reverse phase (4 μm,
2 × 50 mm) column and a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1%
formic acid in water over a 5-min run time. Detection was performed on a
Quattromicro quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray, positive-mode
ionization. The assay was linear over the concentration range 50-5000 ng/mL and
proved to be accurate (103.4-105.4%) and precise (<5.0%CV). Hemolysis (10% RBC)
and use of heparin as anticoagulant did not impact quantitation. Recovery from
plasma varied between 103.0-107.7% and matrix effect was -47.5 to -41.3%. Plasma 
freeze-thaw stability (97.7-104.9%), stability for 3 months at -80°C
(103.4-111.4%), and stability for 4 h at room temperature (100.1-104.9%) were all
acceptable. Incurred sample reanalysis of (N = 64) passed: 100% samples within
20% difference, -0.7% median difference and 1.1% median absolute difference.
External validation showed a bias of less than 1.1%. This assay will help further
define the clinical pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib."

"In the European Union, the use of veterinary drugs belonging to the A6 group is
prohibited in food-producing animals according to Commission Regulation (EU) No. 
2010/37. The aim of this study was to improve the analytical control strategy by 
developing a single method to analyse residues of prohibited pharmacologically
active substances in milk. For this, a single method was developed to analyse 16 
prohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five different
substance classes at required or recommended levels: nitroimidazoles at 3 μg
kg-1, nitrofurans at 0.5 μg kg-1, chloramphenicol at 0.1 μg kg-1, dapsone at 5 μg
kg-1 and chlorpromazine at 1 μg kg-1. Milk sample preparation started with an
acid hydrolysis combined with a derivatisation. These steps were followed by a
clean-up consisting of a dispersive solid-phase extraction and a liquid-liquid
extraction. Finally, the sample extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography
combined with tandem mass spectrometry, operating alternately in the positive and
negative mode. The method was fully validated according to Commission Decision
2002/657/EC for bovine milk and additionally validated for caprine milk. The
validation proved that the method is highly effective to detect and confirm all
16 substances in bovine and caprine milk and, additionally to quantify 15 of
these substances in bovine milk and 13 of these substances in caprine milk. This 
study resulted in a new multi-class method to detect, quantify and confirm the
identity of 16 prohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five
different substance classes in two types of milk."

"Although current LC-MS technology permits scientists to efficiently screen
clinical samples in translational research, e.g., steroids, biogenic amines, and 
even plasma or serum proteomes, in a daily routine, maintaining the balance
between throughput and analytical depth is still a limiting factor. A typical
approach to enhance the proteome depth is employing offline two-dimensional (2D) 
fractionation techniques before reversed-phase nanoLC-MS/MS analysis
(1D-nanoLC-MS). These additional sample preparation steps usually require
extensive sample manipulation, which could result in sample alteration and sample
loss. Here, we present and compare 1D-nanoLC-MS with an automated online-2D
high-pH RP × low pH RP separation method for deep proteome profiling using a
nanoLC system coupled to a high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometer. The
proof-of-principle study permitted the identification of ca. 500 proteins with
∼10,000 peptides in 15 enzymatically digested crude serum samples collected from 
healthy donors in 3 laboratories across Europe. The developed method identified
60% more peptides in comparison with conventional 1D nanoLC-MS/MS analysis with
ca. 4 times lower throughput while retaining the quantitative information. Serum 
sample preparation related changes were revealed by applying unsupervised
classification techniques and, therefore, must be taken into account while
planning multicentric biomarker discovery and validation studies. Overall, this
novel method reduces sample complexity and boosts the number of peptide and
protein identifications without the need for extra sample handling procedures for
samples equivalent to less than 1 μL of blood, which expands the space for
potential biomarker discovery by looking deeper into the composition of
biofluids."

"IMMH-010 is a prodrug of YPD-29B, which is a novel PD-L1 inhibitor. A specific
and sensitive LC-MS/MS method with polarity switching was developed and validated
for the simultaneous determination of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B in rat plasma, liver, 
brain, urine and fecal samples. Method validation was investigated to demonstrate
the lower limit of quantification linearity, precision and accuracy, matrix
effect and recovery, stability and dilution reliability for IMMH-010 and YPD-29B.
This validated method was successfully applied to investigate the
pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B in
rats. After oral administration of IMMH-010 maleate to rats, IMMH-010 was rapidly
and extensively converted to the active metabolite YPD-29B. The areas under the
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of IMMH-010 and YPD-29B were proportional
to the dose in the range of 10-100 mg/kg. IMMH-010 was primarily distributed in
the adrenal gland, lymph nodes, heart, liver and spleen. YPD-29B was mainly
observed in the liver, lymph, kidney, and lung. Approximately 28.81% of the
IMMH-010 dose was recovered in the urine and feces within 72 h, including
unchanged IMMH-010 (7.99%) and YPD-29B (20.82%). The results of this study may be
useful as a reference for further development of IMMH-010 and PD-L1 inhibitors.
